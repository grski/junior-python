# About the Author

So, since I've dragged you, dear Readers, through all this talking, maybe now a few words about me - who am I to be preaching wisdom here?

Well, no one other than just plain Olaf.

## Górski, Just an Ordinary Human

I'm a guy who didn't even graduate high school, yet started working full-time as a programmer while still in school, for not much money, but still. A year and a half later, having seen quite a lot and just landed at my fourth company, I reached that supposedly mythical level of earning a great salary while working remotely for an international client. Dreams come true. Allegedly. Plus, I have to admit, more luck than brains. Three and a half years later, give or take, here we are. I have about five years of experience. I work as a Tech Lead, supervising several people. I've had an adventure running my own company, where at its peak I employed about 8 people full-time. I'm no longer surprised by contract amounts like $40k/month or equity bonuses worth half a million. Life is funny. Not long ago $3k seemed like a lot.

It's been an interesting journey, because before that, while still in school, I tried my hand at various jobs. Some construction work, handing out flyers, welding, tutoring, retail - everything, really. Whatever paid, so to speak. And here might be a little surprise for you - how come some former laborer is creating programming books? Why am I even mentioning this? Because that's who I am, rather authentic - I want readers to know who's talking to them.

Somewhere in the middle of high school, I started making simple websites for clients, until I turned eighteen. A month later, I managed to find a normal job in IT. I partially attended school and worked remotely as some kind of junior Python developer. Then just a quick decision to skip the final exams as a form of protest against the system, a few company changes, and boom - good money. I wish I could say it was in dollars, but not yet. Though the dollars did come when I was running my own company. But not anymore - that's a story for another time. Now I'm a well-behaved employee.

## Currently

I work as a Lead, coding in Python, Django, Architecture, plus I sometimes handle Jira, some basic PO work, plus managing and mentoring members of my team, and that's about it. No bunkers, but it's still pretty awesome.

Day to day, I run my blog [grski.pl](https://grski.pl), go to the gym, write, live, stay sober, wrestle with demons. Life is great, but not always colorful sometimes.

I don't know, I think I'm just a pretty normal guy. Sometimes a bit cringe here and there, but hey, that's just who I am.

As for life achievements - under the search terms "tinder statistics" and "python advantages" I rank pretty high on Google. Sometimes even first place. I used to always be first, but I forgot to renew my domain and had to reindex from scratch xD

I went from a nobody, arriving in the big city with only $400 in my pocket, to Mr. Programmer - still a nobody, but with a fuller head at least, thanks to which I don't worry about whether there's something to eat tomorrow, or calculate calories in milk based on which percentage has a better calorie-to-price ratio to meet my daily needs more cheaply.

Hence, it seems to me that if I could make it, many of you can too. Not everyone though. Most will probably drop out along the way.

## It Won't Be Easy

Most of those who don't drop out will at best be average code jockeys. There will remain a handful of determined ones who will achieve great things. I'm not saying this looking down from above. I just know how it works. This isn't easy money. You think that initial year and a half, I just worked eight-hour days, some easy project, and went home? I did as much overtime as I could, grabbing experience from more senior workers. I've slept in the office because it wasn't worth going home anymore. Something like that isn't normal, but the results I achieved aren't normal either. However, in general, I don't recommend it - I'm only writing about this not for you to follow my example, but to make you realize that above-average results often require above-average effort. Although, on the other hand, it wasn't that much effort for me - it was kind of enjoyable. Still, something had to be sacrificed - free time in this case.

I often sat for 12 hours, on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays. Thanks to fate, I found the perfect mentor, a golden person, because otherwise I don't know. I waded up to my ears in crap, in legacy projects I wouldn't wish on anyone, and above all, I was extremely lucky. Don't expect it to be similar for you. It might be, but probably won't.

In my free time, I try to help other people learn to code, whether through running various workshops, projects, or mentoring, usually completely for free. From experience, I know that most simply give up. By the way, speaking of people I've somewhat helped take their first steps on the programming path - so far there have been about five who, starting from zero, persevered and got their first job. The shortest time was about half a year, the longest about two years. It all depends. Hence partly the idea for this book, because it turns out I do have something to share - first, and second, I don't want to explain the same things to the nth person. This way I'll write it once and it's done! Great!

I'm not some programming wizard, but I manage, sometimes worse, sometimes better, I don't complain. There are probably better ones, probably worse ones, I don't dwell on it too much, I just do my thing. Some people like my activities whether on forums or elsewhere, others don't, considering me an idiot or a buffoon - some will like the book, others won't. I understand, that's cool, I respect that, no problem.

One somewhat unusual aspect of my work is that I also try to touch on areas beyond just hard skills and talk about the soft side of professional life, or life in general. Sometimes, actually often, it was precisely these things that determined how my fate unfolded, rather than specific technical skills.

## So, to Sum Up

At the end of the day, I have only one intention - that this book, the knowledge contained in it, the dose of specific and sometimes offensive humor, the biased and infantile style, would somehow help someone. Maybe it will work out.

Plus, this is also the result of realizing that above a certain threshold, money stops playing such an important role, and more important things come to the surface. The need for some meaning, for doing something higher than just another thousand on the paycheck. Okay, enough of my rambling.

My exact salary history and such details you'll find in another chapter, somewhere towards the end of the book. If not my words and myself, then at least they might convince you that perhaps this book is worth reading.
