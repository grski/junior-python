# Pros and Cons of Working as a Programmer

This book is about programming, right? There are millions of such books out there, all encouraging you to enter the IT world, to code, because it's the future, because it means a great lifestyle, millions of coins in your wallet, fame, glory, and whatever else.

Well, no, I disagree. It's time to pour a bucket of cold water on many people who aspire to and dream about the IT industry. This is not some magical, perfect job that has only advantages and no downsides. ABSOLUTELY NOT. Get that out of your head.

## Cons

To combat this misconception, I decided to write in my book about why... you shouldn't become a programmer.

### Health

Programming means long hours at the computer, often too long. This is not healthy. Your eyes, spine, and other things suffer. It's not without reason that this saying has become popular recently: sitting is the new smoking.

A sedentary lifestyle and staring at a computer destroys our bodies, and quite severely. If someone doesn't have enough self-discipline to counteract this sitting with gym, exercise, or physical activity, then honestly, the money earned from work is worthless because they won't have the health to enjoy it.

Another issue is stress. Believe it or not, when you finally reach a point where you're a reasonably competent programmer and start being responsible for certain things, deadlines, and so on, stress will inevitably appear.

How can you not stress when you broke something in the code and suddenly it turns out the client is losing tens of thousands every hour because you did something stupid? What about when a trivial problem that you were supposed to finish by end of day turns out to be something complex that you'll spend the next week on, despite your declarations that it would be done in a few hours?

Although these are foreign questions to me, as I simply can't stress about work, despite being heavily involved in it, I know many people have such problems.

It might sound like bragging, but for some reason that's just how it is. I simply live with an unshaken conviction that ultimately I'll manage, everything will work out, and it will be fine.

### Constant Learning

What about the time you have to spend on learning, constant learning? This industry changes so fast that if you don't develop yourself, you fall out of the game. Simple. I'm not joking.

You don't keep up with new things for one, two, three years and suddenly you become somewhat worthless in the market or you reach stagnation, where your knowledge doesn't increase, nor do your skills.

And in our industry, stagnation doesn't just mean lack of progress, but essentially regression. However, this mainly applies to junior developers. They must develop hard and a lot. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense.

Seniors or good mid-level developers have mastered certain fundamentals and skills that are kind of key and unchanging, which allows them somewhat more laziness.

Besides, the more experience you have, the less you actually code afterward, spending more time reading code, mentoring others, attending meetings, doing conceptual and architectural work.

For some, the fact of mandatory constant learning is a minus, for others a plus. I'm actually happy about it because I'm genuinely interested in what I do, I love my profession, so the fact that I need to stay up to date with certain things is a nice excuse to spend a bit more time with code.

However, there are people for whom programming is simply a 9-to-5 job and that's it. And that's also normal, correct, and cool, if I may say so. Not everyone has to be a complete enthusiast. There's also a need for people who just do their thing and that's it. They can be good programmers, they won't be the best, the cream of the crop, but still.

Such people, meaning average, or not that outstanding, are also needed, it's completely normal. In fact, most people work on this basis. Enthusiasts are rare.

### Bad Projects

We don't always work on cool apps. The reality is that sometimes ugly projects appear that nobody wants to do, but someone has to. And you know what?

You, as a Junior, have a higher chance that your employer will throw you into such a mess. Why? Because if something is already messed up, you can't make it worse, that's one.

Two, at the beginning you don't have much choice, unless you're a good programmer. And actually, I hope you'll become one.

Those are the realities, unfortunately. Because when we're already wallowing in such a swamp that nothing helps, well, you can basically throw a complete newbie there, because whatever they do, it won't get worse, and it'll be cheaper.

I gave a somewhat extreme example here, but very likely if you end up working at a poorly managed shop, which often happens in first jobs.

### Stereotypes

IT also comes with a stigma - prepare for all your friends, family, and other people you know to expect vast knowledge from you in fields that are even slightly related to programming.

Which phone to choose, which computer, which router, how to configure it, and so on. It doesn't matter that you don't work as an admin, devops, or some help desk. Everyone expects you to know everything related to IT/technology. It's not a big disadvantage, but after a while it can be irritating.

Pro tip: never volunteer anywhere to 'reinstall someone's system', especially for free. Then everyone will come to you with their technology problems and blame you for them.

If you want to be a good soul, at least take something as compensation.

Besides, the moment you reveal yourself as a programmer, so to speak, a large part of people will attach a certain label to you regarding how much you earn. In some, this arouses jealousy. Although this is actually an advantage, because thanks to it you can easily notice who cares about your material status and who is a true friend.

### The 'Employee Market'

Another disadvantage is that the market isn't all that rosy. What, bootcamp trainers told you that 60k programmers are needed, right?

Well no, nonsense. Because many specialists are needed, but... Exactly, specialists. Not beginners. People are needed who already have knowledge and have been in the industry for 2, 3, 4, or 5 years. There are plenty of such beginners who want to become programmers because they heard it pays well - wherever you look, there's some wannabe programmer.

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against people who want to retrain or become programmers. Fine, let them do it. I just find it funny when people think that writing hello world in python and one CRUD app will make them programmers who after two weeks will be capable of working and it's all so easy, simple, and pleasant.

And this is no joke, for most job postings where the keyword 'junior' or 'no experience required' appears, up to 500 CVs can come in. I've seen such cases. I suspect that soon the number of CVs received for junior positions will increase to four digits. There are really many people who want to get in. The problem is that most of them can't do anything or have inflated expectations and zero understanding of the industry.

You really need to stand out now to get into some sensible place. Sure, there are companies that even train programmers themselves and pay them to learn, guarantee a job, but this usually comes with two things: a loyalty contract for X years, and two - working on projects that nobody wants to touch. Besides, it happens veeeery rarely for a company to go for something like that.

Unfortunately, life is not a fairy tale, calculations are made here. Investment in an employee is not selfless - it's exactly what I wrote, an INVESTMENT. It's done with the thought that it will pay off with interest.

I'm saying this more towards people who think it's incredibly easy to get a job in IT, there's a huge hunger in the market, and so on. No. I appeal to you, to those who picked up this book with the approach that you'll read one or two books, program for two weeks at home, and boom, 10k a month. IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

You have a position of strength when you already have several or more years of experience, considerable knowledge, and reputation. Then you can pick and choose from offers.

Or not, because everyone wants to get into those good companies, so you have more competition and it can vary. The better the company, the higher requirements it can set, because it has more candidates. End of digression.

I'm not saying here that it's impossible to get a job without experience - look at my case, but it's not as easy as some describe. You need to get this into your head.

On the other hand, let's not exaggerate - finding a job doesn't require herculean effort. Provided you have something in your head, follow the NBD principle, and master solid knowledge and fundamentals.

Willingness alone is not enough. I know this will sound surreal, but there's a whole bunch of people who declare they'll work for free for even half a year, just to get a job.

As always, everything depends on you, your projects, open source contributions, and what knowledge you have. The greater your skills, the higher the chance you'll find some job, but you also need to remember that presentation and the way you search matters.

### Dream Job

'Do what you love and you won't work a single day.' Or something like that. I don't know who said it, but they're an idiot. Even if programming excites you as much as it does me, at work you'll still face a lot of things that aren't strictly programming, but are necessary in the software development process.

Meetings, discussions, paperwork, convincing clients about certain solutions, or their random whims. I could list many things here.

Of course, if you work in a proper company where work is sensibly organized, some of these elements are cut out. However, you can't cut out everything.

If you think you'll come to some job and just sit at a desk for 8 hours creating awesome code, you're wrong.

However, let's assume you're not. You sit all day in front of your computer and write code. Is this an ideal situation? No. Why?

First and foremost, the main part of a programmer's work is thinking. Before you code something, you need to think it through, and thoroughly. Actually, most of the time spent at work is thinking and reading code.

Typing on the keyboard is a small part. And that's good. If it were otherwise, no one would be able to work 8 hours. Even in this model, where most of the time is research and thinking, it's hard to be productive for those 8 hours.

It just won't happen. Simply. It's unrealistic. In programming, there are hard moments, days when you feel like you don't know anything and who knows why you work here - the so-called impostor syndrome. Contrary to appearances, it's a very popular phenomenon.

There are also bad projects, tasks that we don't want to sit down to, but we have to anyway. Programming can really be exhausting, and very much so.

And I'm telling you this as someone who once worked in construction. Actually, sometimes I miss how simple it was. Sometimes I'd gladly plaster some corners somewhere. Perfectly, to a nice right angle. Then smooth it over nicely. Oh yes. Then spackle twice and sand to a mirror finish. There's no better feeling.

Sure, such work is physically tiring, sometimes very much, especially when you have to work on scaffolding in huge humidity because the paint is drying, and in 35-degree heat in summer, or when you have to move a million blocks or carry a pallet of 55-pound bags of plaster to the 4th floor.

After such a day at work, you come home, eat, and basically go to sleep right away. Obviously. At least at first, because then you get used to it and it doesn't tire you as much. Mentally, however, you're completely free.

During such work, I would simply close myself in my own world and my thoughts were elsewhere. Time passed very quickly, surprisingly. Sometimes even pleasantly, especially when the work crew was nice. Plus you have tangible results of your work. You create something you can see, touch, see progress.

Really. I'll probably remember the time spent with a spatula in hand fondly. It taught me a lot. If I had to name the hardest element of such work, it's the financial aspect and the limitations that a meager paycheck places on you. Although this has also been changing lately, because now due to a strong deficit in the market, working in physical labor, you can earn decent money. Seriously.

Anyway. My point is that after such a day at work, I could be less exhausted than after a day working as a programmer.

To summarize, working as a programmer, especially when you're fascinated by this field, is wonderful. However, it's not without flaws, it has some. Some are mundane, others serious, but they exist. Most of them don't bother me at all, but they can be troublesome. It's important that you're aware of them before you make a hasty decision to retrain and so on.

## Pros

Enough complaining, now it's time for the advantages. Oh boy. Where to start.

### Money

What can I say. The money is good. However, it's worth noting that there are extreme differences. I know people who have similar experience to me, but earn from 20% to 80% less than me. In IT there's a chance to earn well, quite a big one, but you also need to put in effort and know what you're doing. Soft skills also matter.

### Development Opportunities

IT is such a dynamic industry that you can never complain about boredom. Things evolve so fast here that development paths and possibilities are virtually countless. That's super cool. On the other hand, as I already mentioned, for some this might be a disadvantage. Either you move forward or you die, because if you stand still, you're going backward.

### Interesting Work

To write a piece of code and create a sensible product, you need to understand how it works, what the business case is, what the context is, and so on. This means that you essentially need to learn a given business topic. This makes it so you can momentarily become sort of a person from another industry and try new things. For me, it's incredible that working on new products, I often learn a lot about other industries and professions. That's super cool and interesting in my opinion.

Additionally, the technicalities and implementation details of our work can be really non-trivial, especially if someone has that engineering flair.

### Often Remote

These days, work in IT is very often remote. This brings certain disadvantages that I've already written about, where socialization and social life suffer, at least for some, but at the same time gives us many opportunities. Remote work is primarily huge flexibility in schedule and life. Convenience - we don't waste time commuting. However, the most important thing for me about remote work is probably that we can work for companies from all over the world and use the purchasing power of a stronger currency from a wealthier country while living in a place where the local currency has weak purchasing power.

Speaking plainly, if you live in a country where the local currency is weak compared to the dollar or euro, earning in euros or dollars will probably give you an even bigger paradise compared to your colleagues who earn in the local currency.

Additionally, a company that is from abroad and works remotely can also do the math. Is it better to pay an engineer from the US, where the cost of living is higher and they won't agree to work for less than 20k USD per month, let's say, or give 10k USD to someone from a lower cost-of-living country who will probably do the work similarly or equally well, will be super happy with the salary and despite that half the cost because for 10k USD in that country you can probably live at a higher standard than in the USA for 20k USD? Of course, the numbers are made up, but they illustrate the situation.

This arbitrage is one of the few cases where differences in earnings between the average salary and the IT salary can be enormous. In wealthy countries like Switzerland or Norway, this isn't the case. I mean, it exists, of course, but these aren't differences on the order of 10x the average salary.

### Employee Market

Despite the fact that I debunked rumors about such a market in the section about the disadvantages of working as a programmer, this didn't apply to everyone. If you really know your stuff and have things reasonably figured out, the demand in the market is huge. Really. And it won't be any less.

Recession is coming. Okay, inflated nonsense that has no right to live in the free market will die. However, the remaining companies will grow. The desire for optimization and cost reduction in all enterprises will also grow. What does this mean? Often automation of processes, staff reduction, optimization of existing processes. Familiar things, often done with technology.

So in my opinion, in the IT sector we currently have a VERY strong employee market, a skilled employee market. This situation will only deepen in my opinion.

## Summary

Being a programmer has its pros and cons. Honestly, more pros in my opinion. However, there are also certain cons that make this profession and some people's expectations realistic. This is not some holy grail of work. No. It's a job like any other, just currently trendy and lucrative. For some, however, it will be a torment not worth the effort, as they have better predispositions in other directions and that's where they should rather head.

I've listed here some pros and cons, maybe it will give you a slightly broader perspective.
