# Pros and Cons of Working as a Programmer

This book is about programming, right? There are a million such books, all encouraging you to enter the world of IT, to program, because it's the future, because it's life at a high level, millions of coins in your wallet, glory, and whatever else.

No, I don't agree. We need to pour a small bucket of water on a large part of people who aspire to and dream about the IT industry. This is not some magical, perfect job that has only pluses, no minuses, and so on. ABSOLUTELY. Get that out of your head.

## Cons

To fight this belief, I decided to write in my book why... it's not worth programming.

### Health

Programming means long hours at the computer, often too long. It's not healthy. Eyes, spine, other things. It's not without reason that the saying "sitting is the new smoking" has started to function recently.

A sedentary lifestyle and staring at a computer destroys our bodies, and really strongly. If someone doesn't have enough self-discipline to negate this sitting later through the gym, exercises, or physical activity, then honestly, the money earned from work won't be of any use to them because they won't have the health to enjoy it.

Another issue is stress. Believe it or not, but when you finally reach a place where you're a fairly normal programmer and start being responsible for certain matters, deadlines, and so on, stress will inevitably appear.
