# Pros and Cons of Being a Programmer

This book is about programming, right? There are millions of such books, all encouraging you to enter the world of IT, to program, because it's the future, because it's living the high life, millions of coins in your wallet, glory and whatnot.

Well, no, I don't agree. We need to pour a small bucket of water on a significant portion of people who aspire and dream about the IT industry. This is not some magical, perfect job that has only advantages and no disadvantages. ABSOLUTELY. Get this out of your head.

## Disadvantages

To fight this belief, I decided to write in my book why... programming might not be worth it.

### Health

Programming means long hours at the computer, often too long. This is not healthy. Eyes, spine, other things. There's a reason why the saying "sitting is the new smoking" has started circulating recently.

A sedentary lifestyle and staring at a computer destroys our bodies, and it does so quite severely. If someone doesn't have enough self-discipline to counteract this sitting with gym, exercise, or physical activity, then honestly, the money earned from work won't be of much use because they won't have the health to enjoy it.

Another issue is stress. Believe it or not, but when you finally reach a place where you're a somewhat normal programmer and start being responsible for certain things, deadlines and so on, stress will inevitably appear.

How can you not stress when you've broken something in the code and suddenly it turns out the client is losing tens of thousands every hour because you did something stupid? What about when a trivial problem you were supposed to solve by the end of the day turns out to be something intricate that you'll spend the next week on, despite your declarations that it would be done in a few hours?

Even though these are foreign questions to me, as I simply can't stress about work, despite being heavily involved in it, I know that many people have such problems.

It sounds a bit like bragging, but for some reason, that's just how it is. I simply live in an untroubled belief that ultimately I'll manage, everything will work out, and it will be fine.

### Continuous Learning

What about the time you have to dedicate to learning, constant learning? This industry changes so quickly that if you don't develop yourself, you're out of the game. Simple. I'm not joking.

If you don't keep up with new things or innovations for a year, two, three, suddenly you become somewhat worthless in the market or reach stagnation where your knowledge doesn't increase, nor do your skills.

And in our industry, stagnation means not just lack of progress, but essentially regression. This mainly applies to junior developers though. They need to develop strongly and extensively. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense.

Seniors or good regular developers have mastered certain basics and skills that are somewhat key and unchanging, which allows them to be a bit lazier.

Moreover, the greater your experience, the less you actually code, and the more you read code, mentor others, participate in meetings, do conceptual work, architectural work.

For some, the fact of being forced to continuously learn is a disadvantage, for others an advantage. I actually enjoy this because I'm really interested in what I do, I love my profession, so having to stay current with certain things is a nice excuse to spend a bit more time with code.

However, there are people for whom programming is simply work from 8 to 16 and that's it. And that's also normal, correct, and okay, so to speak. Not everyone has to be a complete enthusiast. We also need people who just do their thing and that's it. They can be good programmers, they won't be the best, the cream of the crop, but still.

Such people, meaning average, or not quite outstanding, are also needed, it's completely normal. In fact, most people operate on this principle. Enthusiasts are rare.

### Bad Projects

We don't always work on cool apps. The reality is that sometimes there are nasty projects that no one wants to do, but someone has to. And you know what?

You, as a Junior, have a greater chance that your employer will throw you into such crap. Why? Because if something is already messed up, you can't make it worse, that's one.

Two, at the beginning you don't have much choice, unless you're a good programmer. And actually, I hope you become one.

Such are the realities, unfortunately. Because when we're already wallowing in such a mess that nothing can help, well, you can basically throw a complete newbie in there, because whatever they do, it won't be worse, and it will be cheaper.

I've given a somewhat extreme example here, but very probable if you land in a Januszsoft, which often happens in first jobs.

### Stereotypes

IT is also a stigma - prepare yourself for the fact that all friends, family, and other people you know will expect great knowledge from you in areas that are even slightly related to programming.

Which phone to choose, which computer, which router, how to configure it, and so on. It doesn't matter that you don't work as an admin, devops, or some other help desk. Everyone expects you to know about everything related to IT/technology. It's not a major disadvantage, but after some time it can be irritating.

Protip: never offer to "reinstall someone's system" anywhere, especially for free. Then everyone will come to you with their technological problems and blame you for them.

If you want to be a good soul, at least take that proverbial bottle as compensation.

Besides, the moment you reveal yourself as a programmer, so to speak, a large portion of people will attach a certain label to you regarding how much you earn. In some, it arouses envy. Although this is actually an advantage, because thanks to this you can easily spot who cares about your material status and who is a true friend.

### 'Employee's Market'

Another disadvantage is that the market is not as rosy as it seems. What, did the bootcamp trainers tell you that 60k programmers are missing, right?

Well no, nonsense. Because many specialists are needed, but... Exactly, specialists. Not beginners. People who already have knowledge and 2, 3, 4, or 5 years in the industry are needed. There are plenty of beginners who want to become programmers because they heard it pays well, everywhere you look, there's some wannabe programmer.

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against people who want to retrain or become programmers. Great, let them do it. I'm only amused by people who think that writing hello world in python and one CRUD app will make them programmers who will be capable of working after two weeks and that it's all so easy and pleasant.

And this is no joke, most job postings with the keyword 'junior' or 'no experience' can receive up to 500 CVs. I've seen such cases. I suspect that soon the number of CVs received for junior positions will reach four digits. There are really multitudes of people who want to get in. The problem is that most of them don't know anything or have inflated expectations and zero understanding of the industry.

You really need to stand out a bit now to get into some sensible place. Sure, there are companies that even train programmers themselves and pay them for learning, guarantee work, but this usually comes with two things: a loyalty agreement for X years, that's one, two - working on projects that no one wants to touch. Besides, it happens very, very rarely that a company would go for something like this.

Unfortunately, life is not a fairy tale, here things are calculated. Investment in an employee is not selfless - it's exactly what I wrote, an INVESTMENT. It's made with the thought that it will return with interest.

I'm saying this more towards people who think that getting a job in IT is incredibly easy, that there's a huge hunger in the market and so on. No. I'm appealing to you, to those who picked up this book with the approach that they'll read one or two little books, program for two weeks at home and boom, 15k per month. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

You have a position of strength when you already have several/dozens of years of experience on your back, considerable knowledge and reputation. Then you can pick and choose among offers.

Or maybe not, because everyone wants to get into these decent companies, so you have greater competition and it can go either way. The better the company, the higher the requirements it can set, because it has more candidates. End of digression.

I'm not saying here that it's impossible to get a job without experience - look at my case, but it's not as easy as some describe it to be. You need to hammer this into your head.

On the other hand, let's not exaggerate - finding a job doesn't require Herculean effort. Provided that you have something in your head, follow the NBD principle and master solid knowledge and basics.

Willingness alone is not enough. I know this will sound surreal, but there's a whole crowd of people who declare they'll even work for free for half a year, just to grab some work in IT.

As always, everything depends on you, your projects, open source contributions, and what knowledge you possess. The greater your skills, the greater the chance you'll find some work, but you also need to remember that presentation and the way you search also count.

### Dream Job

'Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life.' Or something like that. I don't know who said it, but they're an idiot. Even if programming excites you as much as it does me, you'll still face a lot of things at work that aren't strictly programming but are necessary in the software development process.

Meetings, discussions, paperwork, convincing the client about certain solutions or their various whims. I could list many things here.

Of course, if you work in a decent company where work is sensibly organized, some of these elements are cut out. However, you can't cut everything out.

If you think you'll come to some job and just sit at your desk for 8h, creating awesome code, you're mistaken.

However, let's assume you're not. You sit in front of your computer all day and type code. Is this an ideal situation? No. Why?

First of all, mainly, a programmer's work is based on thinking. Before you code something, you need to think about it and think thoroughly. In fact, most of the time spent at work is thinking and reading code.

The actual typing on the keyboard is a small part. And that's very good. If it were otherwise, no one would be able to work 8 hours. Even in this model, where most of the time is research and thinking, it's hard to be productive for those 8h.

It won't be like that. Simply. It's unrealistic. In programming, there are tough moments, days when you feel like you don't know anything and who knows why you're working here - the so-called impostor syndrome. Contrary to appearances, a very common phenomenon.

There are also bad projects, tasks we don't feel like sitting down to, but we have to. Programming can really be exhausting, and very much so.

And I'm telling you this, a person who once worked in construction. In fact, sometimes I miss how simple it was. Sometimes I'd gladly set up some corners somewhere on some reveals. Perfectly, to a nice right angle. Run a goldband nicely over it. Oh yes. Then plaster twice and polish to a mirror finish. There's no better feeling.

Sure, such work tires you physically, sometimes very much, especially when you have to work on scaffolding at high humidity because the paint is drying, and in 35-degree heat in summer, or when you have to move a million hollow blocks or carry a pallet of 25kg bags of plaster to the 4th floor.

After such a day at work, you come home, eat, and basically go straight to bed. Clear enough. At least at the beginning, because later you get used to it and it doesn't tire you as much. Mentally, however, you're completely free.

I, during such work, simply closed myself in my world and my thoughts were elsewhere. Time passed very quickly, contrary to appearances. Sometimes even pleasantly, especially if the work crew was nice. Plus you have tangible effects of your work. You create something you can see, touch, see progress.

Really. I'll probably remember the time spent with a trowel in my hand quite fondly. It taught me a lot. If I had to name the hardest element of this type of work, it would be the financial aspect and the limitations imposed by a meager salary. Although even this has been changing recently, because now due to a strong deficit in the market, working as a physical worker, you can earn serious money. Seriously. Programmer15k sometimes hides.

In any case. What I mean is that after such a day at work, I could be less exhausted than after a day working as a programmer.

To summarize, a programmer's work, especially when you're fascinated by this field, is wonderful. However, it's not without disadvantages, it has quite a few. Some are prosaic, others serious, but they exist. For me, most of them don't bother me at all, but they can be persistent. It's important that you're aware of them before you make a decision, on a whim, to retrain and so on.

## Advantages

Enough complaining, now it's time for advantages. Oh boy. Where to start.

### Money

What's there to say. The money is right. However, it's worth noting that there are extreme differences. I know people who have similar experience to me, but earnings 20% to 80% lower than mine. In IT, there's a chance to earn well, quite a large one, but you also need to put in effort and know what you're doing. Plus soft skills come into play.

### Development Opportunities

IT is such a dynamic industry that you can never complain about boredom. Things evolve here so quickly that development paths and possibilities are practically countless. That's super cool. On the other hand, as I already mentioned, for some this can be a disadvantage. You either move forward or die, because if you stand still, you're actually moving backward. It's starting to smell like Coach Mike. Every day we stray further away from God.

### Interesting Work

To write a piece of code and create a sensible product, you need to understand how it works, what the business case is, what the context is, and so on. This means that you actually need to learn about that business issue. This means you can temporarily become like a person from another industry and try new things. For me, it's amazing that while working on new products, I often learn a lot about other industries, professions. That's super cool and interesting in my opinion.

Plus, the technical details and implementation specifics of our work can be really non-trivial, especially if someone has that engineering knack.

### Often Remote

In current times, work in IT is very often remote. This carries certain disadvantages, which I've already written about, where socialization and social life especially suffer, at least for some, but at the same time it gives us many possibilities. Remote work is primarily great flexibility in schedule, life. Convenience - we don't lose time on commuting. However, the most important thing for me in remote work is probably that we can work for companies from all over the world and leverage the purchasing power of stronger currency from wealthier countries, living in a place where the local currency has weak purchasing power.

Speaking plainly, if you live in such Poland where the złoty is a token made of cardboard and the government regularly arranges to screw this token without lube, where the dollar is at five złoty, then earning in euros or dollars will probably give you even greater eldorado here compared to your colleagues who earn in złoty.

Additionally, a company that's from abroad and works in remote mode can also count. It's better to pay an engineer from the USA, where living costs are higher and they won't agree to work for less than 20k USD per month, let's say, or give 10k USD to a Pole who will probably do the work similarly or just as well, will be super happy with the salary and yet be half the price because with 10k USD in Poland you can probably live at a higher level than in the USA with 20k USD? Of course, the numbers are made up, but they illustrate the situation.

Poland is probably one of the few countries where the differences in earnings between the average salary and IT salary are so huge. You don't have this in Norway. Not necessarily in Switzerland either. Similarly in Germany. I mean, it exists, of course, but it's not differences of 10x the average salary.

### Employee's Market

Despite debunking rumors about this in the part about disadvantages of working as a programmer, this didn't apply to everyone. If you really know your job and understand anything sensibly, the market demand is such that it's mind-boggling. Really. And it won't get smaller.

Recession is coming. Okay, inflated crap that has no right to live in a free market will die. However, the remaining companies will grow. The desire for optimization and cost reduction in various enterprises will also grow. What does this mean? Often automation of processes, reduction of employment, optimization of existing processes. Familiar things, often done using technology.

So in my opinion, in the IT sector we currently have a VERY strong employee's market, a qualified employee's market. This situation will only deepen in my opinion.

## Summary

Being a programmer has its advantages and disadvantages. Honestly, more advantages in my opinion. However, there are also certain disadvantages that make this profession and some people's expectations more realistic. This is not some holy grail of work. No. It's a job like any other, currently fashionable and lucrative. For some, however, it will be torture that's not worth the effort, as they have better predispositions in other directions and should rather aim there.

I've listed here both disadvantages and advantages, maybe this will give you a bit of a broader perspective.
