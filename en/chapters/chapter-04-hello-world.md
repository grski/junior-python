# Hello, World!

Finally, we're starting to play with coding! Phew, it took us a while, didn't it? Just about 50 pages. Anyway.

Hello, World! These words are quite a popular phrase in programming, at least their English equivalent - Hello World!

This is something that's traditionally considered to be the text that the first program a beginner programmer creates in their career will print - displaying the text 'Hello World!' or 'Hello, World!' in the console.

We'll do something similar, but a bit differently, in two ways. Why? Well, on the Internet, you can often come across the opinion that in Python, there's already a solution for everything, ready-made code that someone else has created, we just import it, use it, and that's basically what programming in Python is all about.

Just gluing a program together from ready-made blocks. The main thing is to know which blocks to glue together.

Well, often that's true. Very often. It's no different with hello world. The examples shown here should be copied into a file and run as described in the previous chapter or typed directly into the interpreter. I recommend the second option, at least while we have one-liners/a few lines. For longer things, however, I recommend working with files rather than just the interpreter.

So in Python, the standard Hello World can be replaced with:
