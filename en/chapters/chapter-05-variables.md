# Variables, Introduction

Alright, we've done some printing, it's okay. However, it's not something very exciting. Can Python do anything else at all? Otherwise, it's kind of a weak language. Of course, it can do much more.

## Storing Values

The next concept I'd like to introduce is the idea of variables.

What's this about? Let me explain.

We have our computer. It has some memory, whether it's RAM or disk storage, right? Right. It's quite capacious, fast, sometimes even permanent. So it would be nice to be able to use it in some way during programming. Our brains are quite good for thinking, but not so much for remembering various things, especially permanently.

The basic tool we use to store or retrieve something from computer memory are variables/constants.

It's a way to put some value into computer memory and assign it a kind of identifier so that we can use it normally later. How does it look in Python? Simple matter.

```python
variable_name = value
```
