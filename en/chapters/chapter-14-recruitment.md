# Recruitment

Everything related to recruitment.

## How the Process Looks

Generally, recruitment processes look quite different, but they usually consist of similar building blocks. Some are quite short, others long, but the most popular pattern will be recruitment in the following style...

### Specifics

First will be a phone/Skype interview. Here, the first technical tasks/questions may already come up, aimed at filtering out a wide group of candidates who are completely unsuitable for the given job, but usually at this stage, these are often simple things that a non-technical person asks you about. Most of the topics you might be asked about, at least based on my experience, will concern you and your professional profile - what you've done, what you want to do, where you're heading, why you're changing companies.

Contrary to appearances, such things are also important because it matters what kind of candidate you are, what your character is, and whether it will be good to work with you, really. Although it should be noted that your personality type matters more in small companies. What I mean is that in a large company, there are many more different teams with different characters, where there's a much greater chance that you'll fit in somewhere. In a small company, it's harder - you need to fit better.

Does this mean you'll be hired based solely on character? No. It's not THAT important. Remember one thing - don't be a jerk. That's it.

Does this mean you should pretend to be someone you're not? Definitely not. If you pretend during the interview, it will come out during work anyway, what you're like. You'll suffer, the employer will suffer. Why?
