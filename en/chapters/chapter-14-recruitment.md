# Recruitment

Everything related to recruitment.

## How the Process Looks Like

In general, recruitments look quite different, but they usually consist of similar building blocks. Some are quite short, others long, but the most popular pattern will be recruitment in the following style...

### Specifics

The first will be a phone/Skype conversation. Here, the first technical tasks/questions may already come up, aimed at filtering out a wide group of candidates who are completely unsuitable for the given job, but usually at this stage these are often simple things that a non-technical person asks you about. Most of the issues you might be asked about, at least from my experience, will concern your person and your professional profile, what you did, what you want to do, where you're heading, why you're changing companies.

Contrary to appearances, such things are also important, because it's important what kind of candidate you are, what your character is and whether it will be good to work with you, really. Although it should be noted that your personality type matters more in small companies. What I mean is that in a large company there are many more different teams with different characters, where there is a much greater chance that you'll fit somewhere. In a small company it's harder - you have to fit better.

Does this mean you'll only be hired based on character? No. It's not THAT important. Remember one thing - don't be a jerk. Simple as that.

Does this mean you should pretend to be someone you're not? Definitely not. If you pretend during the interview, your true self will come out during work anyway. You'll suffer, the employer will suffer. What's the point?

Then there might be an in-person meeting or a take-home assignment in the form of some project or a Codility-type test.

In the in-person meeting, of course, you should expect more specific questions. Here most often a strictly technical person will join or lead the conversation. What kind of questions can you expect? Well, it depends.

Obviously, no one will ask you about things that aren't in your CV or about things completely unrelated to the position. That's rather clear. If it's different, it's a bit unprofessional from the interviewer's side.

As for those things that are in it, you can safely assume that someone might quiz you on every word placed in your CV. Besides that, there are also certain questions from general computer science, algorithms, or database basics that often come up, regardless of the position and company.

Naturally, it's worth taking into account the specific offer we're applying for and the company's profile. If it's a company largely dealing with database topics, it's simple that you can expect questions from that field.

A small note before we move on, some tasks are designed so that you won't be able to solve them, sometimes it will be necessary to ask for clarification, sometimes it won't be possible at all. Some recruiters use such a technique, or another one, introducing some stressful element during the task execution, to check how the candidate handles situations under pressure.

An example of something like this might be trying to convince you that a solution that is actually good is incorrect, or some interference during solving that is meant to distract you. Rather very rarely something like this is used, but I've heard about such practices, so be aware, although I doubt someone would use something like this towards a Junior.

If you're not sure about something, ask, don't be ashamed. Make sure you understand the task correctly, give some example and ask if that's what they mean. It's not like you get some negative points for every question you ask or something like that. It shows that you're not afraid to ask and communicate. For me that's a plus.

I'll give you the list of recruitment questions I encountered a bit later.

Then there might be more conversations or not. In any case, after some time, if the company has a normal approach to candidates, you should receive some feedback about whether you succeeded or not, if not, then what would be worth working on.

In short: a typical Polish recruitment can be divided into:
- chat about you, your experiences
- technical conversation
- optionally homework assignment

And I'll reveal to you that I currently become rather picky - if a recruiter sends me an assignment that will take me several hours, then... Thanks for the recruitment. And I'm not saying this from a position of arrogance, I don't consider myself God knows who, absolutely not.

I just value my time, because those few hours I'll spend on solving will pass irretrievably. Besides, in my free time I prefer to program what I want, not some boring recruitment project.

However, you, at the beginning, when you're going to or looking for your first job or simply have little experience - you can't be picky.

The exception to this rule are assignments from IT giants. In such I haven't happened to work, that's first, secondly I haven't heard that they use such practices.

### What Questions Will Appear?

How do recruiters determine questions? Is there some list that everyone chooses from? From my experience and from conversations with other people, it turns out that... no.

Such lists rather don't exist. Recruiters simply ask questions that... Someone once asked them. They have several of their favorite questions, sometimes they exchange them among themselves and that's it. Of course, there are also some standard example questions that appear everywhere, but you'll find such in the list of questions that I included in this book somewhere below.

There are rather no internal company secret lists that contain questions for potential employees. So here don't strain yourself unnecessarily looking for them. Simply be prepared and that's it. However, it's worth noting that if a company often deals with writing REST API then they'll probably ask about that. Generally, a good tip is to review the company's project profile and see what they deal with daily and prepare for that. If a company works in Python, they won't really ask about Java-related technologies.

What does it mean to be prepared? It's not just knowing some specific issues, no. Recruitment interviews are difficult, they're often stressful, especially if we care about the position. All this hugely affects how you'll work on the task given to you. That's one thing. Two, a common problem is also that someone knows a given issue but can't use it in practice.

Just reading, I don't know, Cormen, is not enough. These are not some scientific research or deliberations, but rather specific problems for which you'll have to find a solution. Besides, are you surprised? Most likely it's the case that your recruiter last had contact with such deep theory when they were finishing studies themselves and today they rather don't remember it, so naturally they won't ask about it, they'll ask instead about specific use, specific problem.

So once again I'll repeat, to be prepared, it's not enough to know or be familiar with some issue, you need to be able to really use it well in practice, because during the conversation, where you'll certainly be stressed, it will be harder for you to come up with new ideas, so it's really good advice that certain things should be just natural for you just like the multiplication table is. At least I hope it is.

### Not Just Knowledge

Remember also that a programmer is not just some encyclopedia or a code typing machine. A programmer is also, and basically primarily, a human, and in people's lives communication and other soft skills are important. Very. Especially when you're starting as a Junior. Watch out for this during the conversation and try to be communicative. I repeat the appeal, don't be a jerk. In short NBJ.

You can be a really super programmer, but if it's hard to work with you, you're not like Peszko and don't create atmosphere, then the employer probably won't be happy, and especially your team.

This will translate into lower efficiency, worse atmosphere in the team, and a decrease in coworkers' satisfaction. It's better to hire someone who's super to work with, who has a good attitude, knows how to work in a team and has nice soft skills, because they'll learn the technical ones and quickly if they're somewhat capable. Simple.

It's much harder to teach someone those skills mentioned earlier, while technical ones are no problem. So know that your skills are not everything, your attitude to problems and solving them is also very important, fitting into the team, you also need to simply be human, avoid being an arrogant jerk and be nice and kind, but in a way that doesn't let others walk all over you. Just like that.

Don't think I'm exaggerating. I myself witnessed when a person, being the most competent in a given field in a specific team, was fired because team work was going rather poorly.

Communication is a must, especially in remote work, but... There's no need to overdo it in the other direction. Don't talk too much. Each additional sentence is a potential chance for you to weave some complete nonsense into it that might cross you off. I know because I speak from experience. You need to have some common sense and know when it's better to say a bit less.

Don't overdo it and be professional. At this stage let's say there's not always room for too much familiarity, so don't come out with such initiative, currently, as a candidate, you're in a position of, let's say, lower status, so give your interviewer due respect and behave professionally.

It's different if your recruiter proposes from the start that the atmosphere should be casual, that there's no need for formal addressing and so on. Usually that's exactly how it is, but it looks good if it's the older person who proposes switching to informal communication, rather than when you, the candidate, somehow force it. That's some advice.

While we're at it, I might mention a few words about attire. Well, I like to follow one rule, which is better to dress too elegantly than come in flip-flops and really embarrass yourself. Attire also speaks about you, similarly your overall appearance. Even if you don't like it, unfortunately, or fortunately, our appearance affects how people perceive us, regardless of whether they are aware of this fact or not.

Here again, common sense will help you again, because what you should wear often depends on the place itself where you're applying, it's known that you can come dressed somewhat differently to an interview at a startup or new software house, and differently to a huge corporation.

However, I usually dress as follows: black pants, simple shirt in subdued colors, if it's a more formal meeting, I add a jacket to that. Such a rather quite safe set that will be appropriate practically everywhere. So remember also that despite the fact that the meat and the most important thing are skills, knowledge and what you're like, presentation also counts. How they see you is how they write you. There are many studies where it was shown that we more willingly attribute positive traits to people who look nice, while to those who look sloppy, negative traits.

So look like something, preferably like a normal person, not a stereotypical programmer, a Mirek who was forcibly pulled out of the basement after two weeks of maniacally playing The Witcher 3. Straighten your back, pull your shoulder blades back, speak clearly and slowly. When you give a hand, give a hand like a human, not a wilted twig. Speak normally, not almost in a whisper so that you can't be heard. Come on! Be someone with dignity!

### Result

What if you don't get in? Well, keep trying, improve your skills. There's no point in giving up. Note, sometimes you have to wait a bit for an answer. If the recruiter doesn't get back to you with information the next day, don't worry, it doesn't mean you didn't get in. Personally, once when I was recruiting, I had the interview somewhere at the beginning of June, and we only arranged the actual job in mid-August, so.

Sometimes you need to wait a week, two, and sometimes there won't be any information at all. I consider this a bit boorish, but unfortunately this is the practice and it's quite common unfortunately. Why is something like this disrespectful?

Well, if a candidate devoted their time, prepared, performed some tasks, came for an interview, they should at least get some information about the state of their knowledge, about what they did wrong.

It doesn't cost much work, just simply sending information, a simple email or two minutes on the phone, and, especially for someone who's just starting, it can help.

If someone doesn't even want to do something like this then... Well, it says something about the company and you should be happy that you don't have to work with such boors. On the other hand - if it's you who shows up for an interview without any preparation, ignoring the interviewer, then congratulations, you ignored NBJ.

You got in, there's an offer? Great. Only...

What about that terrible question that always comes up somewhere along the way, which is how much would you like to earn? How to deal with this? About that in another chapter.

Same with example questions you might encounter.

### Practice

Recruitment is also a skill. At the beginning it might go mediocrely for you. Despite the fact that in other conditions you'll solve the task, live during recruitment suddenly stress eats you up, or you stand still. It happens. That's why it's worth practicing and before recruitment ask someone (e.g. grski) to conduct a test conversation with you. Seriously.

Recruitment is also a test of how well you can sell yourself, without lying of course, and a test of your soft skills, negotiation skills. More than once I happened to earn more than my much more experienced colleagues just because I wasn't afraid to ask for raises or large amounts plus I performed quite tolerably in recruitments because I often participated in them even just for practice, conducted them myself, I was good at them. Thanks to this I could negotiate nice conditions surprisingly often.

### Negotiations

People generally don't like to negotiate, and that's a shame. It's a shame because it simply pays off.

My record is a situation where the hiring bonus I got just by politely asking for it and jumping on a call for 5 minutes was 24,000 PLN. 5 minutes of additional conversation and 24k in the pocket. Damn, the hourly rate comes out nice here.

It's similar with salary. If half an hour of negotiation can bring you 5% higher salary, let's say even 300 PLN monthly, that gives 3600 PLN annually. Already quite a lot. And I remind you that it's only a few minutes usually.

## How I Looked for My First Job

A bit about how these searches looked like for me.

### First Class Spammer

Or first grade. Generally my approach, from the perspective of time not necessarily optimal, was as follows: go through all kinds of announcements. Anything related to programming and somehow at least with backend? Write to them. This was five years ago, year 2017, so there wasn't such an abundance of announcements as now. The bubble wasn't so big.

I wrote to various companies, sent emails, messages. Even when they weren't looking or when I didn't match in terms of candidate profile. I spammed en masse. This went on for weeks. I sent at least 80 applications to various companies. I got maybe 8 or 9 responses. 90% didn't even throw a simple "We'll call you back". I don't blame them.

### Some Results

Nevertheless from those 8 or 9 responses I managed to get 3 emails where I was invited for an interview. In one case it was about a regular position(XD), in the second about a junior, and in the third about an internship.

### First Interviews

I failed the first one at the algorithmic test stage, Codilime. I was missing 10%. Tough luck, moving on.

The second one, which was where the vacancy was for an internship, went like butter. I already saw myself in this job with my mind's eye.

Before the date of the arranged third interview came, I got a phone call. The CEO of one of the companies I spammed found my message in his SPAM folder, but read it anyway. Somehow it happened that I had something in my CV about knowing these whole pythons or that I used them sometime, and they just happened to have something open up, they need a workman.

So I said then that I would be whatever he wants me to be, give me that interview man. So he gave it.

That interview didn't go too great for me. I expected questions about Python, but suddenly surprise because the guy mainly questioned me about programming basics, data structures and such, which weren't my forte then. Fortunately I remembered some basics because I did a course from harvard - CS50, so I managed to piece together a few sentences. However in my head there was still chill utopia, because in my reception, that second interview went perfectly for me.

### Surprise One

Well, it turned out that that internship interview didn't necessarily go as great as I thought. They didn't call back. Here I got a bit sad that nothing came of it and I'll have to spam again, apply that is.

### Surprise Two

Well someone else called back. The CEO from the message in SPAM. He called with information that I made a cool impression, there's still a lot to improve of course, but I'm quite a nice guy so we can work something out.

They offered me remote work, which for me, still being in high school, was ideal. Money, for those times, also okay because I think something like 20 PLN per hour, where on construction you earned 11 PLN, and I gave tutoring for 30 PLN. So yeah.

Taking all this into account I didn't even think for a moment, immediately agreed and by the way informed that last company with which I had an arranged interview that I'll pass.

### Trial Period

Generally the agreement was that first two months I have a trial period, if there's progress there will be extension. So what, I rolled up my sleeves and pushed with the topic.

After two months I got a raise and extension. It worked out.

I was jumping with joy overall. Here again, besides those thanks at the beginning, I want to thank Jakub Gąsiorski and Maciej Mondrzycki. These are the two people who largely are responsible for where I am and who I am. They allowed me to catch first experience, invested and took some risk, hiring an unknown guy, a kid from high school who barely turned 18, to a serious company. Kudos.

### Summary

That's how my search for first job looked like. It wasn't ideal, now I would do it somewhat differently, primarily focusing on a smaller number of companies, writing more personalized messages, I would put more effort into portfolio projects on github, into making a nice CV and better prepare before recruitment interviews. I recommend this to you. Choose several offers or companies that you like. Write proper messages/cover letter even and send them out. Look for offers and companies on justjoinit, probably the best job board.

And speaking of CV...

## CV

A readable, nicely polished CV is half the success. Let's talk about the art of creating a readable CV. I'm not an expert in this field, but it seems to me that I've seen enough CVs to know what is more or less okay and what isn't.

### My Latest CV

To not analyze dry theory, I'll show you an example CV, in this case mine, which I consider quite tolerable.

![First page of cv](./chapters/resources/images/cv_1.png)

![Second page of cv](./chapters/resources/images/cv_2.png)

### Analysis

What does the CV above consist of?

1. Contact Information
   Things like phone number, email address or city of residence. There's no need to provide exact address, but sometimes it's worth it for the recruiter to know more or less where we work from.
2. GitHub
   Probably obvious. A nice portfolio on github helps a lot.
3. Blog
   Here of course not everyone has one, but I actually do. I think I have several nice articles, hence I linked it. This also gives some sense that I show initiative and do something 'from myself'. When I recruited I always gave some small plus for something like this. Additionally having a blog allows the recruiter to read a piece of your text, get to know you in some way. I also had interviews where recruiters openly admitted that they weren't necessarily planning to invite me for an interview, but after looking at the blog they changed their mind. Just remember, no content is better than shit content put there just to be there. While you sit quietly people don't know you're stupid - this saying applies here. So think twice about what you put on your blog and whether you need it. Nothing by force.
4. Brief Summary
   Here in short I presented myself, my values and previous experiences. Short and concise.
5. Experience
   List of subsequent jobs I took. Here can also be internships, participation in various projects etc. Newest at the top, oldest at the bottom. Sorting order. Describe example technologies, what were the challenges, what actions were taken, what was the result and what distinguished this work from others. Such advice.
6. Skills
   That is keywords for recruiters. Recruiters are often non-technical. From technical jargon they might not understand, and the only thing they do is scan CVs looking for specific keywords. This is where to place them. However it's important not to throw everything in here as it comes. If you wrote hello world in Java don't add it to your skills. Assume that you'll be questioned about every skill written here. If they catch you lying it's Game Over.
7. Project Examples
   Also probably clear.
8. Article Recommendations
   If you don't have a blog then skip this. I added such a section because I'm proud of some texts and wanted to expose them.
9. References
   Also optional.
10. Hobbies(?)
    In my case actually lack of this, because I had little space due to large number of entries in Experience, however, as often happens with Juniors, when the CV is somewhat empty, throw in something about yourself about your hobbies, interests, generally what kind of person you are. For junior/intern you're hired more as a person and not specific skills anyway, because one needs to invest, so let yourself be known from a good side.
11. Data Processing Agreement
    At the very bottom in tiny text is the clause that unfortunately needs to be added to every CV, because otherwise the company can't process such a document.

### Photo

For the love of god, don't. This isn't recruitment for president's assistant to throw in photos. No. There's no need. This is some weird Polish invention with these photos in CV. Abroad they don't know this.

### Summary

My CV looks like it looks. I described its elements. This isn't some absolute list, but I think quite okay guidelines. CV necessarily in English. This is IT, here we communicate in English. Plus clean and neat format. As for font there is one rule, anything but Comic Sans. I think that's it.

## Studies and Recruitment

When I was looking for my first job I was a freshly minted eighteen-year-old, being in the last year of high school. Zero education, experience, nothing. And yet it worked out. As you can see it's possible. That's what I note at the beginning, if you doubt yourself, to give you some encouragement. If grski managed then you can too as long as you put some work into it and have some luck. Before we move on to details two words about studies/education.

### Is the So-called Paper Worth Nothing?

Generally one might get the impression that I have a negative attitude and talk about studies in a pejorative way. Nothing could be further from the truth. It seems to me that studies can be a wonderful place where you'll learn a lot and meet wonderful people. However, if you're going there just for the paper because mom told you to, you have no idea what you're doing there, you're not learning anything, well then what's the point.

Then yes, then this whole undertaking makes no sense. Better go work any job because you'll get zero benefit from these studies just suffering only.

If however you sensibly approach the topic of your studies then they will be only an asset and not something that might harm you. Then it's a nice opportunity.

### Do I Regret Not Going to Studies?

Life somewhat chose for me, I was kind of forced to take up work quickly, that's a fact. So one might ask oneself, do I regret it? No. Having 3 years of experience, when my peers somewhere there were just starting to crawl, were interns, I was already managing a team, met wonderful people and developed connections in the industry.

I wouldn't give that up for those additional few years of carefree life.

However, I note that this is just my case. Not everyone will have so much luck. Studies are therefore something that's really worth considering, however it's not a necessary element.

Studies are a nice time to develop connections, because it's easier to talk with Manek, with whom you went to the stairs for beer, who is currently somewhere a Team Leader, and differently with freshly met Tadeusz who is a stranger. There's no one recipe.

### Does Lack of Studies Cross Us Out?

A frequently asked question. Does lack of studies cross out a candidate? Well my dears, if someone judges you only through the prism of your education and not You, as a human, then the question is whether you want to work with such a company? For me that's a red flag right away.

In my entire career and currently one might say dozens of recruitments, only once did it happen that the CEO barged into recruitment and the question fell, I quote:

> Why should we hire you since you don't have studies?

After the technical conversation he already knew why and ultimately they offered me the job. I politely refused. I don't work with boors, however class must be maintained and respect for another human. As if that wasn't enough a year later they wrote again whether maybe something changed :-)

This fate is perverse, sometimes wants to play poker with me.

So no, lack of studies doesn't determine anything.

## What I Knew Going to First Job - Case Study

Today about what specifically you need to know to get your first job, or rather about what I knew when I was looking for my first job. Catchy title, because in different companies there are different requirements for juniors and in one such a guy like me is an intern, and in another already a junior, it varies. Nevertheless this is just my perspective, not some absolute determinant, but these things below allowed me to become a junior python dev, so yeah.

Besides that I'll also describe some of my projects that I included in my CV.

Is what I'll write about here necessary or actually sufficient? I don't know. For me in interviews it was enough, but I didn't have that many of them, so my experience is limited, but let's say that for such an internship you'll manage to get in knowing what's below rather without problem.

The order I chose is rather random, if something is in my opinion important, I clearly mark it.

### Googling

This is the first and probably most important skill. After all, broadly understood computer science is not a science about programming, but about... information processing. Part of this process is searching, analyzing and using given information needed to solve some problem, or implement something new. In short - googling. What do I specifically mean by this?

The ability to concisely rewrite errors, search for information on appropriate sites. Best in English - in this language we'll find of course the most materials.

This is also primarily about not throwing up your hands and stopping in case of standstill, problem, or error, but to do something, look for help, information. That's what it's about. 99% of problems are already solved somewhere, you just need to search. If you hit that remaining 1%, you're rather at such an advanced level that we have nothing to talk about.

### English

This is a necessity. We talked about this in one of the first chapters. The multitude of materials available in English, the fact that it's an international language, popularized and ubiquitous, clearly speaks to the fact that it's necessary for every programmer. Soon probably there will be people who will state that they don't know any foreign languages and they work. Cool, but where? What kind of company is that? Rather I don't know respectable companies employing people without at least basic English.

How without it to cooperate with foreign clients, coworkers who often also aren't from Poland and don't speak Polish? How to read documentation, code?

Plus abroad usually pays better.

> Say what you want, but at the end of the day money must add up.
> 2nd Letter of Prophet Stonogiasz to Poles

What level is needed? Minimally such to be able to read technical documentation of some language/framework. For start that's enough.

### Algorithms and Data Structures

Yes, contrary to appearances you need to know these too. Supposedly it's 'boring theory' and so on, but... It's a necessity. Not to implement them from scratch yourself, but for two purposes. First is passing recruitment, because you'll often be questioned about them, second is awareness of how certain things work under the hood. That is what I always mention, until nausea even.

#### Basic Algorithms

1. Insertion Sort - I probably don't need to explain, simple searching through data structure. Basics of basics.

2. Selection Sort - similar as above. Very basic, inefficient.

3. Bubble sort

4. Merge sort b) searching

5. Linear Search - complete basics

6. Binary Search

And now note - do I know each of these algorithms exactly by heart, implemented several times and used my own, modified versions? No. I simply know how they work - I know their work scheme, their advantages and disadvantages, when to use which. When not to use given algorithm, bad cases and so on. Because that's what's important. Sometimes it dramatically changes the speed of our program's work.

While we're at algorithms, it's worth mentioning something like **recursion**, which in turn is something you need to know to learn Merge sort or Binary search.

The next important thing is **computational complexity**, or so-called **big O notation**. What's it about? So in layman's terms it's the amount of some 'moves' that our program will need to execute given instruction for an n-element data set. We distinguish different cases for different situations - in best case, in worst and in average. Usually the worst is given, because it allows us to state that 'well, it won't get worse'.

So speaking even more simply, it's the number of steps needed to do something and how it grows when there's more of that something to do. There are different complexities - log n, n, n*n, ln n, 1 and so on. About details I won't write, waste of time. Generally the smaller this complexity, the faster the program.

Besides notation about `steps` there's also notation regarding e.g. memory/disk space. Analogically.

#### Data Structures

Here the matter is simple. Data structures are things that can often significantly make our life easier, they are simply some data arranged in a specific way. It's like some specific way of thinking about data. Here it's worth to dig a bit into details.

What specific data structures did I know? I'll tell you.

1. Array - probably everyone knows, right?
2. Dictionary - also?
3. LinkedList - majority?
4. Stack
5. Heap
6. Set
7. Queue
8. Trees
9. HashTable
10. Trie

With those last three being rather extra, above level I would say. What's worth knowing here? What are advantages/disadvantages of given structure, when to use which. Computational or memory complexities for them and basic operations on them like searching, insertion, sorting. Similar as with algorithms.

Again I emphasize that I practically didn't implement any of these data structures myself - I only know approximately how most of them work and look. The only thing I implemented myself was Linked List.

Anyway. This seriously comes in handy. Believe it.

### Tools

You need to know how to operate tools that are needed for work, period. What was this in my case?

**IDE** - PyCharm and Vim. Currently I use practically only PyCharm and now also sublime. Earlier it was vim with plugins, but... with larger project for me PyCharm is simply more convenient.

**Python** - what is virtualenv, pip and these things? What for, for what? And pipenv? Pypi?

**Virtualbox/WSL** - again, worth to learn a bit what it's about, because useful tools, especially when we work on several larger projects.

### Glossary

And now I'll throw in also some various general terms from broadly understood industry. Do you need to know each of them and sometime use given tool and so on? Well no, but it's nice to at least recognize, it gives such orientation and when we talk with other people, maybe more experienced, then certain terms will be familiar to us, at least part. Then, instead of some incomprehensible jargon you hear already minimally familiar babble :D

1. VPS - in short virtual private server, like your own piece of some server you could say
2. VPN - virtual private network, like a private network you could say
3. Docker, Vagrant - that first one I only know the name, and that it's something with servers and app deployment, and that second one read about it, because nice tool
4. HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, SSH, IMAP, POP3 protocols (!) - just superficially which goes to what and how they differ
5. IDE - that is integrated development environment
6. MVC - model, view, controller - data processing model used in considerable amount of modern frameworks
7. API - application programming interface (!)
8. Cookie, Session, Cache - cookies, session, cache storage
9. MySql, Postgres, mongodb, oracle, sqlite, sql, nosql, sql injection - (!) databases, necessity in majority of applications
10. Http codes: 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, but in practice actually enough: 300, 500, 200, 404
11. AJAX, JS, ecmascript, typescript, react, vue - javascript, these things, you know
12. Class, Method, Object-orientation, object-oriented programming, functional, OOP (!!!) Generally object-orientation important matter
13. CMS - content management system
14. DDOS, DOS - such attacks by bad hackers

A lot? Actually no, because majority should have rung a bell sometime. Again - it's about you simply recognizing these terms and knowing what's five.

Most of them are explained here: https://www.hackterms.com/ and if not there? Google. Or DuckDuckGo, whoever prefers what.

### Programming Languages

Okay, now time to talk about languages themselves.

In my case it's Python. What specifically did I know?

First let's start with knowledge of Python's standard library. I was at least superficially familiar with it. What does this mean? Well, that when I wanted to sort something, I didn't write function myself, just bam sort(), or sorted(), depending on case and done. This is simply about such general orientation - here you have actually a list: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html Everything? Absolutely not, simply need to recognize something there, no one expects you know it by heart. Browse documentation, official documentation of Python or Django is super.

What to focus on? Basic data types, structures in Python, most commonly used functions, how OOP looks in Python, what are these generators, iterators, list/dict comprehensions, f-strings, reading, writing to files, opening some link using python, what is GIL and multithreading in python, datetime, collections.

How? Simply by using in practice - make several diverse projects, read other people's code, see how someone solves given problem, compare with your idea.

Besides that I had contact with such libraries in python as BeautifulSoup, Selenium.

Additionally there's still C - but only basics, which I grasped at CS50. That only as part of learning about how certain things look level lower.

Besides that I know html5/css3 at level allowing me to independently create simple templates/modify those more complex.

JavaScript - here actually I google everything, but nice if sometime for test you make yourself, I don't know, script changing div content on site, or something, to see how it works. Remember also that often just JS is enough, don't need gazillion libraries.

With jQuery same as JavaScript - not much I grasp, everything I google as needed. Main thing is to know how to include jquery itself to html, rest google. In 2022 rather I wouldn't bother with it however. JS's API has grown and developed compared to 2017, when I was starting.

### Frameworks

This bit about which ones I had contact with.

Django, flask, long long ago web2py, wordpress. Am I master in each of them? Absolutely - in none, but when I take documentation, then something I'll already create independently there, at least in those first two.

In your place I would aim for two - Django and FastAPI. But that's personal note, I'm not fan of Flask.

### Design Patterns

Actually probably you use them but don't even know about it and that's normal. It's about you recognizing that something like this exists. My knowledge more or less was limited to this then. Maybe few I would name by name, you can additionally read. Singleton. Factory. Such things.

### Testing

Well there is something like this. How does it look? Is it about clicking through app? Well not always. Nice to know what are these unit tests, functional tests, integration tests and such. Do you need to be proficient in them and know how to write them? No, actually majority of programmers not really grasp them so actually, but always plus for this and quite big one.

### Operating Systems

If you heard that there is something like Linux, then cool. If not, well then also not worst. You surely already heard because I wrote about it earlier. Honestly it's heavily dependent on your work whether it will be needed for you, but in my opinion it's good to know at least some basics at start. I'm not telling you to install Gentoo right away or something, but if you'll be able to move around system using console, create, move or change file name, delete it, using linux (or windows) console, that will be great. So we are safe after reading this book.

If it's about me, then I simply used Linux daily, but it's not necessary. From what specifically? Manjaro (mainly), Solus, Ubuntu. For that second I even created package with pycharm-community edition because in repo there wasn't due to it being new project. Do you also need to? Well no. As I wrote above, enough to know how to move around, because who knows pitchfork might come to you to do something using SSH, even on VPS and what? Bummer. And like this bam and you can.

Although now for example I don't use linux at all, because I work on mac, previously it was windows with WSL - that's how it happened at work. I'm just saying, to once again mark, that knowledge of linux isn't necessary, but veeeery useful.

But let's say you're ambitious. What then? Commands: **cd, ls, touch, mv, cp, ps, kill, rm, man, echo, grep*, cat, chown, cat, sed** Additionally how to install packages in given distro, how to update.

That's all.

### Speaking of Systems

Let's talk about things bit lower level. Yes, these horrible, archaic things. Yup. Well imagine that my understanding of computer science, programming and general concept, grew essentially after I grasped a bit these exactly basics.

How computer represents everything in memory, how this memory looks, stack and heap, differences between them, when we use which. How data structures look, why we index arrays from 0, not 1, how this linked list looks from inside, counting in binary system, hex.

What is this assembler, how compilation process looks, what difference is between compiled and interpreted languages, static and dynamic typing.

Sounds boring, but these basics will allow you to become simply better programmers. You can not know this and also find job, but question. Do we want to be broadly understood specialists or maybe simply code typers from templates?

This knowledge, about how it works from low-level side, came in handy for me in recruitment to current job actually.

Worth also to know how to do certain things in console - besides IDE. You better then get to know mechanisms of operation of some tools.

### Debugging

When something goes wrong, then need to fix it.

Make friends at least minimally with debugger, get familiar with debugging methods.

Because besides debugger you can still do bit differently - rubber duck methods, or also 'XD' method. Nice thing. What do they consist in?

That first one in that you explain to someone, something, by default rubber duck, how your program is supposed to work step by step. At some point it might click to you that AHA! After all I wrote it differently or you compare it also with code and look whether actually it is so.

And 'XD' method? It's nothing else than usual method of printing out - you add to code lines printing out some data, some characteristic message, to easily find in logs and then you look where it breaks. For me usually this characteristic message is 'XD' because I'm supporter of this philosophy, but not important.

Last option is going through your code step by step and getting into role of computer - you execute instructions exactly as written, not thinking too much and e.g. on piece of paper substituting values.

So yeah. We grasp debugger. So called debugger. No, no one uses that second term.

### Good Practices

This is mainly about code organization, naming variables and so on. Variables should be named concisely, but accurately, descriptively, specifically. What does variable x do? Well no one knows that, you'll also forget, but if variable is called number_of_clients then already something this tells us.

When it comes to names we talk about, then we have different methodologies of naming variables, methods, classes. Camel case, underscore and so on. Which? No matter, as long as you stick to one consistently. Read PEP8.

Functions that you write shouldn't be too long either - don't stuff everything into one bag. Divide problems into smaller elements, break them down and program, create in way allowing for their multiple use without repeating code.

Think about cases when user won't necessarily behave as you expect. In general before you take up programming then think. Actually programming is mainly thinking and only then writing. Analyze problem, consider different cases and only then take up implementation. It will go faster for you and you'll create better code than if without thought you simply took up writing.

Create code rather simple and flat, nicely divided. Complicated inheritance and millions of abstractions won't be your friend.

Care for code readability, file names, consistency.

### VCS - about git

What VCS is and what for you need it I won't dig into, but one thing is obvious.

You need to know Git. And if you don't know? You can get somewhere there, but rather to such company from which you need to run. It's not difficult, learn it. Git commit, merge, branch, checkout, push, pull, rebase. Probably more for start not needed, for me this suffices.
