# Loose Reflections

This chapter is a collection of my various thoughts, appeals, whatever.

## Backend Is Not a Product

I wanted to write a few words not about programming per se, but about programming as work. I'm a fairly young developer, I have, plus or minus, around two years of commercial experience at this point, and when it comes to sensible teamwork, even less.

That's very little. I'm not that old either, not even 20 yet. That's why I'm constantly learning many things, and at the same time I see that other people, with more experience, older people, are the same - they're also learning, hence the impression that it's worth addressing the topic I'm writing about today, because it seems to me that regardless of age and experience, many people don't understand this.

### Small Enlightenment

Recently, a light bulb went off in my head - the team's task is to create a solution, a product, something that will satisfy the client, fulfill some goal, solve a given problem. Exactly.

What follows from this? I'm writing this from the perspective of a backend developer: backend is not a product in itself.

Frontend isn't either. What exactly do I mean? For some time, I had an approach like - I don't care that functionality X wasn't delivered on time/doesn't work/there are implementation problems - I did my part, the backend works and is beautiful, it's the frontend/devops/qa/whoever who didn't deliver and the product doesn't work.

This is a completely wrong approach, I understood this. Partly, understanding this was helped by how the process of delivering applications looked in our team at one of my previous companies, and what problems we encountered along the way, which resulted mainly from such thinking, and on the other hand, I was slightly directed to look at this problem in my thinking by my de facto mentor.

Also a nice thing here - instead of immediately saying something, I was allowed to try something on my own, think about the matter, and then come to the correct solution independently - respect for that.

### How It Should Be

Ending the digression - when we write backend/frontend, whatever, we can't think only about how cool, beautiful, and amazing it will be from a purely backend/frontend perspective.

We need to think about how others will collaborate with the code, the service we're creating.

Will the solution we're currently creating be convenient for the frontend? Did I clearly describe everything so that the person writing the API integration has no more questions because everything was clearly described in the documentation, additional notes? Maybe I can help them in another way, by talking to them, before, during, and after implementation?

Good questions that, I think, are worth thinking about. It seems to me that you need to be careful not to fall into a kind of egoism, where it seems to us that our work is the most important, we did it well, so someone else is completely to blame and that's it, we have clean hands. It doesn't work like that.

Of course, there are exceptions to the rule - someone deliberately sabotaging work, whatever, but these are such rare situations that they're not worth mentioning. Programming is usually teamwork, and a key element of teamwork is... well, teamwork.

The team is very important, just as it's important that the individual 'elements' of the team work well together. Thanks to this, the whole mechanism will work great. And that's what it's about.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not talking about constantly doing some 'team building', 'integrations', 'meetings', or other nonsense often forced on people. No. I'm not an advocate of scrum or other similar or less similar methodologies.

### Appeal

The essential purpose of this text is just to plant such a thought, a request I would even say.

It goes as follows: when creating your part of the code, service, whatever, think about the person who will read your code, who will use your API, maybe consult with them, describe everything, document it.

Put yourself in the shoes of that frontend, backend, ops person.

Maybe you can do something differently, which will still be a technologically good solution, but will allow the other side to do something faster, without slowing down your work? Who knows.

Just such a question. It's probably worth asking yourself. Of course, you shouldn't go overboard in the other direction - creating a programming disaster because the frontend asked or whatever - no, that's the wrong direction.

As always - you need to find some middle ground, because going to extremes in either direction is bad.

To conclude: let's not be such egoists. Backend is not a product, frontend isn't either. You can have a state-of-the-art backend/front/devops side, but if that other component doesn't work, the product will suck.

Such an approach, where you voluntarily do more for others, will simply make your project work better. The more you help others, the more they will be able to help you. Simply.

This absolutely doesn't mean you should do someone else's work, I think you understand.

This is very important, especially now. It seems to me that we're starting to pay more and more attention to how someone collaborates, because otherwise the team will fail.

So this is very important, which I've emphasized more than once and will probably repeat many more times, especially to you, junior. Because often it's your character and attitude that determine whether it's worth investing in you and hiring you.

So really take this advice to heart.

And what? I guess that's it.

And since we're on the topic of appeals...

## Want It, Write Good Code

A somewhat absurd headline, right?

Yes, but not entirely. There's one very important thing I'd like to tell you, preferably several times so you remember it.

The thing is...

Some people, after a while, give up. They stop wanting to, stop trying. They just have enough. They no longer strive to be better, to make the code they write better day by day. To make every change leave the repo in a better state than before.

Burned out workers.

Never be like that. Please, this is my personal appeal.

Try to be a person who develops every day, who WANTS to.

And that's all.

## Respecting Readers, Respecting the Internet

Before you move on, this is a purely opinion piece, there's nothing technical in it, just my complaining about a certain topic and my perspective. If you only come here for technical topics, you can skip this entry because it's a subjective approach to a certain matter.

What am I talking about? Look at how a large part of websites, especially those in some regions, look today. Without AdBlock they're impossible to browse because simply most of their surface area is ads. Some in video form, others - just images. Auto-playing ads with sound. That's a real nightmare. Same with how much bandwidth all this junk can consume.

Millions of cookies and spying at every step on what you do, just to get additional information about you that can be sold.

Intrusive consents for newsletters, cookies, desktop notifications, GDPR, whatever, popups like: turn off adblocker you peasant because we don't have money.

Adding Facebook, Instagram, Snap plugins everywhere.

Uncompressed graphics weighing several megabytes. Tons of unnecessary JS that makes the page load at a snail's pace.

For me, this is simply a terrible lack of respect for the reader. As soon as I encounter such a site, unless I have to, I don't use it. That's why I try to run my own in the opposite way to those described above.

On my blog there are no integrated plugins for Facebook, Instagram, or anything else, there are no comments, because they're also not needed in my case. There are hardly any graphics in the posts either, although something might be found somewhere, but basically the only image here is my face, which, in my opinion, should be here - I write various things, sometimes smart, sometimes less smart, but I'm not ashamed to sign them with my name, surname, and image.

For this I'm willing to give up anonymity and fondness for privacy - so that my reader knows who writes what they read. Besides, a blog is also an opportunity for me to build a professional image, so an additional plus.

There are also no ads here, and there never will be. There are only links to my profiles on LinkedIn or GitLab. That's all.

My entire site weighs 25.3 kB, and only 4 requests are needed to download it. Loading it takes about a second. Everything served over https. These days it's necessary. And yes, I know someone will tell me it's not 2005 where every kB counts, but it doesn't matter. Why should I, as a user, waste time waiting for your super modern SPA landing to load in 10 seconds? No way.

The global average internet connection speed is currently around 70-80 mbps. Despite this, pages still load at the same snail's pace. How slow? Usually it's 2 to 10 seconds with a median of 6 seconds for complete page load and 4 seconds to render any sensible content. THAT'S A LOT. For comparison, my entire site loads in ~1 second.

![Average speed to complete page load](./chapters/resources/images/slow_load_1.png)

![Average speed to render content](./chapters/resources/images/slow_load_2.png)

Everything is cached through Cloudflare, so the CDN works and speeds things up. How much?

![Meanwhile at grski's place...](./chapters/resources/images/slow_load_3.png)

![2022 and a site without JS. Is it possible? It is.](./chapters/resources/images/slow_load_4.png)

You also won't find Google Analytics here, or any other contraption for tracking how many people read this blog and what you do here. It doesn't matter to me - actually it doesn't matter at all for personal blogs. The only cookie you get from me is probably from Cloudflare.

I can tolerate sponsored articles or content, sure, some product placement. Normal thing, you need to earn money. There are various forms of monetizing reach or content that can be used, which will make both the creator earn and the reader get something out of it. And that's what it's about, because when it's otherwise, it's simply nothing other than a lack of respect for the reader and that's it. I don't respect such things.

So specifically, what is this about? It's about you sometimes thinking, as a creator, whether you really need that two-megabyte graphic as the background of your blog. Whether there necessarily need to be buttons for sharing on Facebook, Insta, Snap, or whatever everywhere. Whether you necessarily need to attack the user with ads, newsletters, and other nonsense.

That's my appeal. Let's take care of the Internet, how it looks and presents itself. It's our common good.

## First Days at Work as a Programmer

A few words about what the first days looked like, at least for me.

Let me start by saying that before my work began, I had a few concerns in my head. The first of them was probably that I wouldn't cope or that the responsibilities would overwhelm me. Natural, although unjustified. Why?

It's the company's job and its recruitment process to check if you're suitable. If you got the job, and you didn't lie on your CV and still can't cope, it's the company's fault, not yours. Simple, the recruitment procedure failed here, not you. And as for ordinary stress, it's probably normal, nothing to worry about. I believe that there are people everywhere, and you can get along with people.

Okay, so how was it in the end?

Well, surprisingly... Honestly, it was calm.

### Calm First Days

The first days at my job I actually spent installing things I needed, waiting for access to appropriate services, setting up the environment, learning about the company structure and how we work, my coworkers. Generally when it comes to programming, practically nothing. Really, the first days are calm.

### Onboarding

Only when I had everything set up did I start programming something. At the very beginning, my Project Leader, to sort of onboard me to the technologies we use, assigned me progressively more difficult tasks to do. Very cool thing. Thanks to this, later when I started doing something on the project itself, certain things were familiar, which allowed me to feel more confident and calmer, which is helpful, especially when you're starting in a new environment, learning new things, and want to make a good impression.

I won't elaborate on technologies here, because they're different for everyone - depends on what position, what project, and so on. However, I'll write below about certain things that are probably universal. Anyway.

### Important Matter

This is also where it shows how important a good Project Leader or supervisor/mentor is. I happened to land quite well, thanks to which really, in my opinion, my onboarding in the new reality and work went quite pleasantly. Sure, some stress accompanied me because I cared about this job, but despite everything I felt good.

### Atmosphere

The atmosphere and way of communication in the company was a bit of a surprise for me. At the beginning, I had an idea that we would all be somewhat 'formal' at first - Mr./Ms., official speech, and so on, but... Nothing could be further from the truth. From the very beginning, a fairly relaxed atmosphere engulfed me. I don't know how it is in other companies, because I work in a rather medium-sized company, where basically you just know most people and that's how it looks.

Nobody here really gets upset either. People are just... helpful. It was a small shock for me, because before I worked a bit in construction, and there people can be, well, different, but not here. That's why

### Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help

At the very beginning, before I started, I had the impression that I would be somewhat on my own - you just get a task and that's it, do it. Can't? Get out.

Well, after starting work it turned out that no - nothing could be further from the truth. First of all, that's what more experienced people are for, and they often willingly help, share knowledge. In fact, more often than not they're paid for it. You can ask for help.

Of course, you can't run around and ask about the smallest thing, but when there's really no other way out, we can't find a solution ourselves and we're wasting time, it turns out there are people willing and even designated to help.

So don't be afraid. Ask. Nobody will twist your head off for not knowing something. Relax. If you go and say 'Hey, can you help me with X? I've already tried this and that, but it's not working out.' there probably won't be a problem, but if you run to your supervisor or another team member with the smallest trivial thing and count on getting the answer handed to you, well... It will certainly be irritating.

Just remember to somehow write down the solutions to these problems. It's embarrassing to ask for the umpteenth time about the same thing. Taking notes is a great thing. Sometimes it's enough to just browse through the message history.

### It's Obvious You Won't Know Everything

As juniors or generally young programmers, we have a certain margin of distance from the boss as a gift. What I mean is that it's rather expected that we won't know everything, sometimes there'll be some mistake, or you'll need to be trained in some topic. It seems to me that every serious employer takes this into account when hiring a novice/junior.

That's also why you should adjust your expectations. It's obvious that you need to have some respect for yourself and earn something, working for the proverbial two dollars is not possible, but it's also a mistake to think that you'll learn to write Hello World in JS and then someone will give you 10k net just for breathing. No, it doesn't work like that.

Anyway.

Therefore, if you don't know something, do something wrong, don't try to clumsily mask your mistakes or ignorance, just speak honestly and admit to mistakes.

### Honesty

I wanted to say something about honesty. Never lie. Simply. Lie on your CV? It'll come out in the interview. Then word spreads, IT is surprisingly a narrow circle, and you'll be burned. Break something, lie, and cover it up? It'll also come out, sooner or later, usually sooner. You don't know something, but officially your task is almost done? It won't work, because ultimately you won't finish it and will only cause unnecessary delays.

It seems to me that a large part of responsibilities in the first job is simply being honest and responsible for your actions, nothing more.

### Universal Things

I'd like to mention here certain things that you can check out even before coming to work, because 90% chance your company will also use them. Usually these are simple things that you figure out immediately, but the more familiar interfaces, the more confident you'll feel and the easier it will be to handle all that information overload, so I'll mention a few technologies worth getting acquainted with somewhere. Hey, maybe you'll even score some points at the interview with this ;)

#### Jira/Confluence

From what I know, a fairly popular task management system is Jira. What it looks like and what's worth knowing about it, you can easily find on the internet. Generally, it's not rocket science - just a dashboard for easier managing who has what to do. Confluence is a sort of knowledge base/documentation.

#### Git/VCS

Every company uses some VCS, you should already know this. If you ended up somewhere where such things aren't really used, and projects are passed on in archives or sent by email, then... Well, something's wrong. Generally, VCS is a necessity and standard.

Currently, the standard VCS is Git. I think most use it. There are others, but that's rather rare.

For Git there are various 'services' that provide repository hosting services, sometimes companies do it themselves, on their own servers. Anyway, you'll most likely be using a repo on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. You can browse what these services look like and peek at what's what.

By the way, if you don't yet have an account on GitHub or somewhere, with your projects and code, I recommend you quickly get one. Similarly, if you don't know Git. You should know the basics.

#### Slack/Google Meets/Microsoft Teams/Zoom

Standard communication tools. There's also company email, which you'll probably receive, so before you can figure out how to set up Thunderbird or another email client, but this is also rather for the select few. The standard is rather that you just get a new Gmail or Outlook.

### Summary

That's what my first days at work looked like. Is it the same in every case? I don't know, but probably similar. Things I described here may seem obvious to some, but... Well, not for everyone.

## Nootropics - Brain Doping

Sometimes it happens that the world is against us and we have to be efficient for certain reasons, not necessarily when we want to. Everyone makes decisions for themselves, we're adults. There are certain substances and ways to boost our efficiency and effectiveness at work. I'll describe two of them here that are worth attention and consideration in crisis situations.

The first drug I'll describe is modafinil. What is modafinil? Remember NZT from the movie Limitless with Bradley Cooper? Something like that, but without the side effects. Officially it's a drug for narcolepsy that increases alertness and concentration, preventing falling asleep. In short - one tablet, you sit down and for 15 hours you close yourself in a room and work. Modafinil is a medication and does not exhibit euphoric properties like, for example, cocaine, which supposedly has a similar effect. It stimulates the brain and neuroplasticity, arouses concentration, gives energy to act. Usually 200 to 400mg.

I won't go into details of how this drug works, how it's metabolized, etc., I'll just write from experience that it works. You sit down, you do a million times more work. Just like that. I don't recommend combining with caffeine because it can be too much.

In some countries it's hard to get officially in pharmacies, unofficially you can buy it for decent money. Note: I'm not encouraging consumption here. I'm just mentioning that such a thing exists, it works on me, and maybe I'm explaining a bit how it's possible that some managers or CEOs work 16 hours a day and still have the drive. :)

There are other drugs similar to modafinil, like Adderall, although Adderall is actually an amphetamine salt. Modafinil is not. Modafinil is the king of nootropics like the lion is the king of the jungle.

Methylphenidate - another creature to read about.

Personally, I sometimes take modafinil when I need to sit down and work very efficiently or learn something difficult, like right now when I'm writing these words.
