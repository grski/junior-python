# Loose Reflections

This chapter is a collection of my various thoughts, appeals, and whatever else comes to mind.

## Backend is Not a Product

I wanted to write a few words not about programming per se, but about programming as work. I'm a relatively young developer, with about two years of commercial experience, and even less when it comes to meaningful team work.

That's not much. I'm not very old either, as I haven't even hit 20 yet. That's why I'm constantly learning many things and at the same time I see that other people, with more experience, older people, are similar - they're also learning. Hence the impression that it's worth addressing the topic I'm writing about today, because it seems that regardless of age and experience, many people don't understand this.

### A Small Enlightenment

Recently, a light bulb went off in my head - the team's task is to create a solution, a product, something that satisfies the client, fulfills some goal, solves a given problem. Exactly.

What does this mean? I'm writing this from a backend developer's perspective, and here's the thing: backend is not a product in itself.

Neither is frontend. What exactly do I mean? Until recently, I had an approach like - I don't care that functionality X wasn't delivered on time/doesn't work/there are implementation problems - I did my part, the backend works and is beautiful, so it's frontend/devops/qa/whoever who didn't deliver and the product doesn't work.

This is completely the wrong approach, I understood that. Partly it helped me understand how the application delivery process looked in our team at one of my previous companies, and what problems we encountered along the way, which mainly resulted from such thinking. On the other hand, I was slightly directed to look at this problem in my thinking by my de facto mentor.

Here's a nice thing - instead of immediately telling me something, I was allowed to try something on my own, think about it, and then come to the correct solution independently - respect for that.

### How It Should Be

Ending the digression - when we write backend/frontend, whatever, we can't just think about how cool, beautiful and amazing it will be from a purely backend/frontend perspective.

We need to think about how others will work with the code, the service we're creating.

Will the solution we're creating be convenient for the front? Did I clearly describe everything so that the person writing the API integration won't have any questions, because everything was clearly described in the documentation, additional notes? Maybe I can help them in another way, by talking to them, before, during and after implementation?

Good questions that, I think, are worth considering. It seems to me that we need to be careful not to fall into a kind of egoism, where we think that our work is the most important, we did it well, so someone else is completely to blame and that's it, we have clean hands. That's not how it works.

Of course, there are exceptions to the rule - someone deliberately sabotages work, whatever, but these are such rare situations that they're not worth mentioning. Programming is usually teamwork, and a key element of teamwork is... well, teamwork.

The team is very important, just as it's important that individual 'elements' of the team work well together. Thanks to this, the whole mechanism will work great. And that's what it's about.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not talking about constantly doing some 'team building', 'integrations', 'meetings', 'gatherings' or other crap often forced. No. I'm not an advocate of scrum or other similar or less similar methodologies. No.

### An Appeal

The fundamental goal of this text is merely to plant a thought, I'd even say a request.

It goes like this: while creating your part of the code, service, whatever, think about the person who will read your code, who will use your API, maybe consult with them, describe everything, document it.

Put yourself in the shoes of that frontend, backend, ops person.

Maybe you can do something differently, which will still be a technologically good solution, and will allow the other side to do something faster, without slowing down your work? Who knows.

Just such a question. It's probably worth asking yourself. Of course, there's no need to go overboard in the other direction - creating a programming mess because the front asked or whatever - no, that's the wrong direction.

As usual - you need to find some middle ground, because going overboard in either direction is bad.

Concluding: let's not be such egoists. Backend is not a product, frontend isn't either. You can have a state-of-the-art backend/front/devops side, but if that other component doesn't work, the product will suck.

Such an approach, where you voluntarily do more for others, will simply make your project work better. The more you help others, the more they will be able to help you. Simple.

This absolutely doesn't mean you have to do someone else's work, I think you understand.

This is very important, especially now. It seems to me that we're starting to attach more and more importance to how we work with someone, because otherwise the team will fail.

So this is very important, which I've already emphasized more than once and will probably repeat many more times, especially to you, junior. Because often your character and attitude decide whether it's worth investing in you and hiring you.

So really take this advice to heart.

And what? That's about it.

And since we're on appeals...

## Want to, Write Good Code

A bit of an absurd heading, right?

Yes, but not entirely. There's one very important thing I'd like to tell you, preferably several times, so you remember it.

The thing is...

Some people, after some time, give up. They stop wanting to, they stop trying. They just have enough. They no longer strive to be better, for the code they write to be better day by day. For each change to make the repo in a better state than before.

Burnt-out employees.

Never be like that. Please, this is my personal appeal.

Try to be a person who develops every day, who WANTS to.

And that's it.

## Disgusting Curiosities in the IT World

Recently I've been observing a disgusting practice. The practice of politicizing the IT world and software development as a whole. What do I mean?

The regular process of destroying our community with political correctness.

For a long time I've been watching this process, but recently when I saw that branches of pull requests were merged into Python's official repository, whose only task was...

Changing the terminology master/slave in the context of processes and so on. As if that wasn't enough, quite recently in the Linux kernel development group a mandatory CoC - Code of Conduct appeared, which sounds... Well, quite specific.

Linus himself, who is known for his 'characteristic' behavior, and for being able to tell everyone what he thinks, often quite sharply, announced that for now he's taking a break to 'work on his character in light of certain changes'. Oh dear people.

These two events made me decide to write my two cents on this topic. I find this highly unpleasant. I consider it completely disgusting, repulsive and unacceptable to turn the IT development process and our society into some politically correct abomination that in no way resembles the beauty of its original form. What exactly do I have a problem with?

Here's a list of a few things.

Let's start with the discussed example of changing Python's terminology. This is not an isolated case. A similar situation already happened a few years ago, but in the context of the Django framework's code. As we can see, this is starting to become a trend.

Highly worrying and stupid, frankly. As we probably all know, in the IT world we have a certain specific dictionary of terms that have more precisely defined, known to all, meanings. Seeing certain words, regardless of the language they appear in, we can to a considerable extent guess what a given function, variable or generally, given code does.

These terms existed for many years, the whole nomenclature is based on them and uses them, often quite accurately describing the abstraction they represent. And now a problem appears.

Because someone comes along who in the name of political correctness starts changing these terms, because they might offend someone, despite the fact that they have no right to, as they're used in other contexts, other meanings, which are also used in dictionaries and frankly no one cares about this, except for a few loud screamers who have gone crazy about certain issues. Unfortunately, from what I see, in the IT world there are rather more somewhat passive people, not very dominant. The introvert type, intellectual, who wants peace.

Unless someone enters their comfort zone so much and disrupts it, such a person won't oppose something much. That's the problem. Because certain circles see this and use this fact to their advantage, to push their agenda everywhere.

This is sad. For me this is complete stupidity that only introduces unnecessary confusion. What if such dilemmas start in all languages?

What if suddenly several different replacement names start functioning for 'uncomfortable' terms, because some will be better than others? Less/more politically correct? This is a recipe for disaster. It's like describing one object with several different names in code. This is not good practice, it leads to bad code and problems with maintenance, debugging and everything basically. That's how I see the effects of these changes.

It certainly won't help here that Guido is starting to withdraw from the Python world, gave up the reins, and recently has had quite some issues - I mean for example his recent declaration, when he stated that he won't teach, consulting, white men, because they're so awful. Instead he intends to help only oppressed minorities.

Oh dear people, please...

Next to discuss is the creation of regulations for the Linux kernel development community. The newly created regulations sound like babble straight from the wet dream of a militant LGBT activist.

Let me be clear - I'm for freedom. I don't care at all who you are, what you do, who you love and who you like. Live and let live. Simple.

In principle these newly created rules sound okay, the problem however is in how they will be implemented, because history has already shown how this usually happens. Something that is supposed to be a tool of freedom for all becomes an apparatus of oppression.

It's simply that SJWs (Social Justice Warriors) gain here a powerful tool that will enable them to completely get rid of people who don't suit their taste. And what doesn't suit their taste is rather the majority than the minority. In principle the rule 'who is not with us is against us' prevails there. Do you see this discrepancy? This dissonance?

In theory they are fighting for social justice, but in practice they are often tyrants who destroy people. Often good people, competent people. If they managed to influence even Linus, who is rather stubborn and controversial in his views, then what will happen to other people? What when some really decent developer 'offends' someone or falls out of favor with the SJW caste?

Do we really need committees of people anywhere who will tell us how to behave, so as not to offend someone? Seriously?

Get this crap out of here, get out of our IT world. Go back to your dumps at universities and other places where you sow this plague. Live there with your political correctness, not with us, in the IT world. Get lost!

Don't ruin something beautiful, because the IT world is like that. Beautiful, inclusive and open, in itself. Look how it looked from the beginning of creation - random people from the Internet, regardless of anything, age, origin, skin color, religion, worked together on various projects, created software that solved the next problems of this world, the smaller and the bigger ones.

Why make a mess in this, interfere and impose some frameworks? Let's move on.

Let's talk about so-called 'positive discrimination', or whatever those idiots call it now. What's it about? Well, if you're a white, heterosexual man, God forbid a Christian, then your life needs to be made difficult somehow, because you're privileged, 'check your privilege!'. Do you understand this hypocrisy?

Next point - quotas in IT. More and more companies are starting to recruit for positions only women/blacks/gays/whatever, to meet 'diversity' standards.

You might think that this doesn't concern Poland, that these are some American problems. Nothing could be more wrong. Imagine that such things also happen in our backyard.

Other, even more terrifying things too - like a sponsor withdrawing funding from a given event because 'diversity' standards weren't met, meaning at a free event, which everyone attends of their own free will, too few women signed up. Why didn't you force them to come, what is this?! Psychosis. And this is a real example from Poland.

How many stories have I heard about a woman being hired for a given position, even though she was less competent than other candidates? I'm not saying women are less competent. Absolutely not. Simply comparing two candidates, one has better skills, will be a better employee, the other won't. It's logical to hire the better person.

When we make this logic a prostitute and hire someone weaker just because they're a woman, or they're black/yellow/green, then something is wrong. St. Thomas is crying somewhere quietly.

Such things, such movements in open source, in companies, in the community, will ultimately lead to worse code quality, departure of pillars and original propagators of open source movements. I don't see a bright future if we don't oppose this plague. Let's just look at one thing. At knowledge, at what someone says and how true it is. At nothing else. Only that should count and that's it.

And I'm aware that by releasing these words into the ether, saying this publicly, I may harm myself, becoming a target for some.

You know what? I don't give a damn. I don't intend to sit quietly and just nod. I've always had a big mouth and said what I thought. I don't intend to change that.

If you're reading this text and you're outraged, then you know what... Tough. That's what freedom of speech is about, that everyone can say what they think, even if you don't like what they say. Deal with it.

## Let's Respect Readers, Let's Respect the Internet

Before you go further, this is a purely opinion piece, zero technical things in it, just my complaining about a certain topic and my perspective. If you're here only for technical topics, you can skip this post, because it's a subjective approach to a certain matter.

What am I talking about? Look at how a large part of websites, especially Polish ones, look today. Without AdBlock they're impossible to browse, because simply most of their surface area consists of ads. Some in video form, others - a regular image. Automatically playing ads with sound. That's a real nightmare. Just like how much bandwidth this whole crap can eat up.

A million cookies and spying on every step of what you do, just to get additional information about you that can be sold.

Pushy newsletter consents, cookies, desktop notifications, GDPR, whatever, popups like: turn off adblock you bastard because we don't have money.

Adding Facebook, Instagram, Snap or whatever else plugins everywhere.

Uncompressed images weighing several megabytes. Tons of unnecessary JS that makes the page load at a snail's pace.

For me this is simply a terrible lack of respect for the reader. As soon as I encounter such a site, if I don't have to, I don't use it. That's why I try to run my site in a way opposite to those described above.

On my blog there are no integrated plugins for Facebook, Instagram or whatever else, there are no comments, because they're not needed in my case. Graphics in news items either, although something might be found somewhere, but in fact the only image here is my face, which, in my opinion, should be here - I write various things, sometimes smart, sometimes less smart, but I'm not ashamed to sign them with my name, surname and image.

In return for this I'm willing to give up anonymity and sympathy for privacy - so my reader knows who writes what they read. Besides, the blog is also for me a possibility to build a professional image, so an additional plus.

There are also no ads here, and never will be. There are only links to my LinkedIn or GitLab profiles. That's it.

My entire site weighs 25.3 kB, and to download it, 4 requests are enough. Loading it takes about a second. Everything served over https. In today's times this is necessary. And yes, I know someone will tell me that this isn't 2005, where every kB counts, but that doesn't matter. Why should I, as a user, waste time waiting for your super modern SPA landing to load after 10 seconds? No way.

The global average internet connection speed is currently about 70-80 mbps. Despite this, pages still load at the same snail's pace. What pace? Usually it's from 2 to 10 seconds with a median of 6 seconds to completely load the page and 4 seconds to render some meaningful content. THAT'S A LOT. For comparison, my entire site loads in ~1 second.

![Average speed of complete page load](./chapters/resources/images/slow_load_1.png)

![Average speed to render content](./chapters/resources/images/slow_load_2.png)

Everything is cached via Cloudflare, so CDN is running and speeding things up. How much?

![Meanwhile at grski's place...](./chapters/resources/images/slow_load_3.png)

![2022 and a site without JS. Possible? Yes.](./chapters/resources/images/slow_load_4.png)

You also won't find Google Analytics here, or any other contraption to track how many people read this blog and what you do here. It doesn't matter to me - in fact it doesn't matter at all in the case of personal blogs. The only cookie you get from me is probably the one from Cloudflare.

I can tolerate sponsored articles or content, cool, some product placement. Normal thing, you have to earn. There are various forms of monetizing reach or content that can be used, which will make both the creator earn and the reader get something out of it. And that's what it's about, because when it's different, it's simply nothing else but a lack of respect for the reader and that's it. I don't respect such things.

So what exactly is this about? It's about you sometimes thinking, as a creator, whether you really need that two megabyte image as your blog background. Whether buttons for sharing on Facebook, Instagram, Snap or whatever else must be everywhere. Whether you must attack the user with ads, newsletters and other nonsense.

This is my appeal. Let's take care of the Internet, how it looks and how it presents itself. It's our common good.

## First Days as a Programmer

A few words about how the first days looked, at least for me.

Let me start by saying that before my work started, I had a few concerns. The first was probably that I wouldn't manage or that the responsibilities would overwhelm me. Natural, though unjustified. Why?

It's the company's and its recruitment process's task to check if you're suitable. If you got the job, and you didn't lie in your CV and despite this you don't manage, then it's the company's fault, not yours. Simple, the recruitment procedure failed here, not you. And as for regular stress, it's probably normal, no need to worry. I'm of the opinion that there are people everywhere, and you can get along with people.

Okay, so how was it?

Well, contrary to appearances... Honestly, it was calm.

### Calm First Days

The first days at my work I actually spent installing things I needed, waiting for access to appropriate services, setting up the environment, getting to know the company structure and how we work, my coworkers. Generally if it's about programming then practically nothing. Really, first days are calm.

### Onboarding

Only when I had everything set up did I start programming something. At the very beginning my Project Leader, to kind of onboard me into the technologies we use, assigned me increasingly difficult tasks to do. Very nice thing. Thanks to this later, when I started working on the project itself, certain things were familiar, this allowed me to feel more confident and calmer, this is helpful, especially when you're starting in a new environment, learning new things and want to make a good impression.

I won't elaborate on technologies here, because they're different for everyone - depends on what position, what project and so on. However, I'll write below about certain things that are probably universal. In any case.

### Important Matter

Here it also shows how important a good Project Leader or superior/mentor is. I happened to get a good one, thanks to which really, in my opinion, my onboarding into the new reality and work went quite pleasantly. Of course, there was some stress accompanying me, because I cared about this job, but despite everything I felt good.

### Atmosphere

The atmosphere and way of communication in the company was somewhat a surprise to me. At the beginning I had an impression that we would all be somewhat 'formal' at first - Mr/Ms, formal speech and so on, but... Nothing could be more wrong. From the very beginning a rather loose atmosphere surrounded me. I don't know how it looks in other companies, as I work in a rather medium-sized company, where basically you know most people anyway and that's how it looks.

No one gets angry here either. People are simply... helpful. This was a small shock to me, because earlier I worked a bit in construction, and there people can be, well, different, but not here. Therefore also

### Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help

At the very beginning I had an impression, before I started, that I would be somewhat left to myself - you just get a task and that's it, do it. Can't do it? Get out.

Well, after starting work it turned out that no - nothing could be more wrong. First of all, there are people with more experience and often they're happy to help, share knowledge. Heck, more often than not they're paid for it. You can ask for help.

Of course, you can't run around and ask about every little thing, but when there's really no other way, we can't find a solution ourselves and we're wasting time, it turns out there are people willing and even assigned to help.

So don't be afraid. Ask. No one will bite your head off for not knowing something, not understanding something. Calm down. If you go and say 'Hey, can you help me with X? I've already tried this and that, but somehow it's not working.' then there probably won't be a problem, but if you run to your superior or another team member with every little thing and expect a ready solution, then... Well, it will be irritating for sure.

Just remember to somehow write down the solutions to these problems. It's silly to ask about the same thing several times. Making notes is a great thing. Sometimes it's also enough to just browse through message history.

### It's Obvious You Won't Know Some Things

As juniors or generally young programmers, we rather have a certain distance from the boss as a gift. I mean that it's rather expected that we won't know everything, sometimes there will be some mistake, or in some topic you'll need to be educated. It seems to me that any serious employer takes this into account when hiring a novice/junior.

This is also a reason why you should adjust your requirements. It's known that you need to have some respect for yourself and earn something, to work for a proverbial two zloty, you can't, but it's also a mistake to think that you'll learn to write Hello World in JS and someone will then give you 15k netto just for breathing. No, that's not how it works.

In any case.

Therefore, if you don't know something, you did something wrong, don't try to clumsily mask your mistakes or lack of knowledge, just be honest and admit your mistakes.

### Honesty

I wanted to say something more about honesty. Never lie. Simply. You'll lie in your CV? It will come out in the interview. Then the word spreads, IT is a small circle despite appearances, and you'll be burned. You broke something, lied and covered it up? It will come out too, sooner or later, usually sooner. You don't know something, but officially this is your task and it's almost done? It won't work, because ultimately you won't finish it and only make everything unnecessarily prolonged.

It seems to me that a large part of responsibilities in the first job is simply being honest and responsible for your actions, nothing more.

### Universal Things

I'd like to mention here certain things that you can check out even before coming to work, because 90% they'll be used in your company too. Usually these are simple things that you understand immediately, but the more familiar interfaces, the more confident you'll feel and easier it will be to handle this whole flood of information, so I'll mention a few technologies that are worth getting to know somewhere. Heck, maybe you'll even score some points with this in the interview ;)

#### Jira/Confluence

From what I know, Jira is a fairly popular task management system. How it looks and what's worth knowing about it, you can easily find on the internet. Generally rocket science isn't here - it's just a dashboard for easier managing who has what to do. Confluence is a kind of knowledge base/documentation.

#### Git/VCS

Some VCS is used in every company, you should already know that. If you ended up somewhere where such things aren't really used, and projects are passed e.g. in archives or sent by email, then... Well something's wrong. Generally VCS is a necessity and standard.

Currently Git is such a standard VCS. I think most use it. Others happen, but it's rather rare.

For Git there are various 'services' that provide repository maintenance services, sometimes companies do it themselves, on their servers. In any case you'll most likely use a repo on GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket. You can browse how these services look and check what and how.

By the way, if you don't have an account on GitHub or somewhere yet, with your projects and code, I recommend you quickly get one. Similarly, if you don't know Git. You should know the basics.

#### Slack/Google Meets/Microsoft Teams/Zoom

Standard communication tools. In addition there's also company email, which you'll probably get, so before you can set up Thunderbird or another email client, but that's also rather for the chosen ones. The standard is rather that you simply get a new Gmail or Outlook.

### Summary

That's how my first days at work looked. Does it look like this in every case? I don't know, but probably similarly. Things I described here may seem obvious to some, but... Well, not to everyone.

## Nootropics - Brain Doping

Sometimes it happens that the world is against us and we have to be productive for certain reasons, not necessarily when we want to. Everyone makes decisions for themselves, we're adults. There are certain substances and ways to boost our productivity and efficiency at work. I'll describe two of them here that are worth attention and consideration in crisis situations.

The first drug I'll describe is modafinil. What is modafinil? Remember NZT from the movie Limitless with Bradley Cooper? Something like that, but without side effects. Officially it's a drug for narcolepsy that enhances alertness and concentration, preventing sleep. In short - one tablet, you sit down and for 15h you lock yourself in a room and work. Modafinil is a drug and doesn't show euphoric properties like for example cocaine, which supposedly has similar effects. It stimulates the brain and neuroplasticity, arouses concentration, gives energy to act. 200 to 400mg usually.

I won't go into details about how this drug works, how it's metabolized etc., I'll just write from experience that it works. You sit down, you do a million times more work. Just like that. I don't recommend combining with caffeine because it might be too much.

In Poland officially it's medium hard to get in pharmacies, unofficially you can buy it for decent money. Attention: I'm not encouraging consumption here. I'm just mentioning that such a thing exists, it works on me, and maybe somewhat explaining how it's possible that some managers or presidents work 16h a day and still have energy. :-)

There are other drugs similar to modafinil, like adderal for example, but adderal is actually an amphetamine salt. Modafinil isn't. Modafinil king of nootropics is like a lion, like the king of the jungle.

Methylphenidate - another creature to read about.

Personally I sometimes take modafinil when I need to sit down and work very productively or learn something difficult like now, when I'm writing these words.
