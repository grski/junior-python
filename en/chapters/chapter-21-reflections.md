# Loose Reflections

This chapter is a collection of my various reflections, appeals, whatever.

## Backend is Not a Product

I wanted to write a few words not about programming per se, but about programming as work. I'm a fairly young developer, I have plus minus, at the moment, about two years of commercial experience, and if we're talking about meaningful work in a team, even less.

That's very little. I don't have many years on my back either, because I'm not even 20 yet. That's why I'm still learning many things and at the same time I see that other people, with more experience, older people, are similar - they're also learning, hence the impression that it's worth addressing the topic I'm writing about today, because it seems to me that regardless of age and experience, many people don't understand this.

### A Small Enlightenment

Recently, a light bulb went off in my head - the team's task is to create a solution, a product, something that will satisfy the client, fulfill some goal, solve a given problem. Exactly.

So what? I'm writing this from the perspective of a backend developer, so: backend is not a product in itself.

Frontend isn't either. What exactly do I mean? Until a certain time, I had an approach like - I don't care that functionality X wasn't delivered on time/doesn't work/there are implementation problems - I did my part, the backend works and is beautiful, it's frontend/devops/qa/whoever didn't deliver and the product doesn't work.
