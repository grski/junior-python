# Classes and OOP

## Classes

You can think of classes, in simplified terms, as just certain collections of functions. Functions created inside a class are suddenly called `methods`.

Classes can be 'connected', which is called inheritance. When one class inherits from another, it takes on its methods, unless we override them. Example of a class:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from queue import Queue

from orderbook.transaction import Transaction
