# Epilogue

Well, that's about all I had to say.

Surprisingly, quite a bit has accumulated. Wow, over 200 pages. Not bad.

A touching moment.

## What Now?

In addition to reading this book, simultaneously or even before reading it, I recommend familiarizing yourself with the following resources:

1. https://realpython.com/ <- Here you'll find excellent summaries of various topics, whether it's list comprehensions, types, printing, or loops. Look for everything there and use it to read about details I haven't covered here.
2. Learning Python, 5th edition - Mark Lutz <- Definitely browse through. You can read chapters selectively, I haven't gone through the whole thing myself, skipping chapters that didn't interest me, but this tome is a damn encyclopedia. Highly recommended. Unlike Real Python, where content is somewhat simplified, here things are described step by step and very extensively. I believe this is an ideal foundation for further development and should be read in parallel or even before my book.
3. [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) - probably the best course on Computer Science basics. In parallel with this book and Learning Python.
4. Effective Python, 2nd edition - Brett Slakin <- An excellent book to work through after you've read the current book and Learning Python. You'll significantly polish your Python skills.
5. Fluent Python - Luciano Ramalho <- A book similar to Effective Python. Optional.
6. Designing Data Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppman <- Once you finish this book, CS50, Learning Python (part), and Effective Python, it's good to broaden your horizons and look here. An excellent book about designing not just code but entire systems.
7. Understanding Software - Max Kanat-Alexander <- Another thing to read.
8. [Zalando API Guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/) <- at least skim through
9. PyCoder's Weekly / Python Weekly / UnKnown news <- Nice newsletters that send you a collection of interesting links/articles and tools from the Python world and beyond every week.
10. python-awesome, django-awesome, fastapi-awesome <- GitHub repos that collect lists of popular, proven, and interesting projects that will often make your life easier.
11. Sebastian Opałczyński <- I recommend his work and various projects, he also creates educational content. Courses, training, etc. Kilograms of pure knowledge. This is a person who shaped me to a large extent and pulled me up to where I am. Highly recommended.
12. Remote - Jason Fried <- about remote work, which today is an indispensable element.
13. [Blog: The Pragmatic Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/)

Resources to broaden your horizons, which can be read a bit later.

1. Understanding Programming - Gynvael Coldwind <- if you think you've just scratched the surface of low-level basics in this book, read this. An exceptionally valuable book, but I'd mark it as optional because it's not easy and might discourage you. However, it's worth working through this volume. I also recommend Gynvael's other work, a very inspiring and well-known figure in the scene.
2. The Pragmatic Programmer - Thomas Hunt <- what can I say. A classic.
3. Web Application Security - Securitum <- An excellent book about security in the context of web applications from world-class experts. By the way, an interesting fact - Poland has one of the stronger representations when it comes to security. Poland stonks.
4. Modern Software Engineering - David Farley <- About modern ways of software development.
5. Extreme Programming - Kent Beck <- A bit about how the software delivery process looks and ways of collaboration.
6. Deep Work - Cal Newport <- about working with focus.

As for practice, stay tuned - I should soon release a collection of exercises worth working through to gain some practice. Check the blog/LinkedIn.

I believe that if you diligently read and work through the materials above, you'll gain solid knowledge allowing you to start applying for jobs. However, it's required that you actually perform tasks independently, read with understanding, create analogies and comparisons, and be able to speak on a given topic. Additionally, I'll note that I know some tasks may seem trivial now, but still, do them. The point is to get you as accustomed as possible to writing code and familiar with Python's standard library.

## This is the End, There is Nothing More

Yup. Thank you for reading and good luck. To those who purchased this book, I offer a small bonus. If you need advice on something, you can reach out to me. I'll try to help.

Feel free to reach out with questions about your career or perhaps for a mock interview. I can't promise I'll help everyone, but I'll try my best. I'll also honestly assess your knowledge and provide feedback if needed.

I might try to recommend the more capable ones somewhere. Who knows.

Remember, someone helped me once too, and I want to pass the baton forward. This means I'm just a human, not some unknown entity. If you write to me, it's okay, I don't bite. I'll try to help as best as I can.

Don't forget about https://github.com/grski/junior-python-exercises where by making pull requests to the repository you can get additional tips plus it will always be something that enriches your GitHub with contributions ;)

Thank you for reading.

That's all from me, have a nice day and goodbye.
