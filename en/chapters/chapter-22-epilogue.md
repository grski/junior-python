# Epilogue

I think that's all I had to say.

Surprisingly, quite a bit has accumulated. Wow, over 200 pages. Not bad.

A touching moment.

## What Now?

Besides reading this book, simultaneously or even before reading, I recommend familiarizing yourself with the following items/resources:

1. https://realpython.com/ <- Here, various topics are excellently summarized, whether it's list comprehensions, types, printing, or loops. Look for everything there and read there about the details I haven't covered here.
2. Learning Python, 5th edition - Mark Lutz <- Definitely browse through. You can read chapters selectively, I haven't gone through the whole thing myself, skipping chapters that don't interest me, but this tome is a damn encyclopedia. Highly recommended. Besides Real Python, where you have somewhat simplified content, here things are described step by step and veeery extensively. I believe this is an ideal base for further development and this position should be read in parallel or even before my book.
3. [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) - probably the best course on the basics of Computer Science. In parallel to this book and Learning Python.
4. Effective Python, 2nd edition - Brett Slakin <- A great book to go through after you've read the current position and Learning Python, then look here. You'll polish your Python quite significantly.
5. Fluent Python - Luciano Ramalho <- A book similar to Effective Python. Optional.
6. Designing Data Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppman <- When you finish this book, cs50, Learning Python (part), and Effective Python, it's nice to expand your horizons and look here. A great book about designing not so much the code itself but the entire system even.
