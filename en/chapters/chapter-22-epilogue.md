# Epilogue

I guess that's all the things I had to say.

Surprisingly, quite a bit accumulated. Wow, over 200 pages. Not bad.

A touching moment.

## What Now?

In addition to reading this book, simultaneously or even before reading, I recommend getting acquainted with the following resources:

1. https://realpython.com/ <- Various topics are excellently summarized here, whether it's list comprehensions, types, printing, or loops. Search for everything there and read up on details that I didn't cover here.
2. Learning Python, 5th edition - Mark Lutz <- Definitely browse through it. You can read chapters selectively, I didn't get through the whole thing myself, skipping chapters that didn't interest me, but this tome is a proper encyclopedia. Highly recommended. Apart from Real Python, where the content is somewhat simplified, here things are described step by step and very extensively. I think it's an ideal base for further development and should be read alongside or even before my book.
3. [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) - probably the best course on Computer Science fundamentals. Alongside this book and Learning Python.
4. Effective Python, 2nd edition - Brett Slatkin <- Great book to work through after you've read this book and Learning Python, then look here. You'll polish your Python quite significantly.
5. Fluent Python - Luciano Ramalho <- A book similar to Effective Python. Optional.
6. Designing Data Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann <- Once you've finished this book, CS50, Learning Python (part), and Effective Python, it's nice to broaden your horizons and look here. Great book about designing not just the code itself but the entire system.
7. Understanding Software - Max Kanat-Alexander <- Another thing to read.
8. [Zalando API Guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/) <- browse through at least briefly.
9. PyCoder's Weekly / Python Weekly / UnKnown news <- Nice newsletters that send you a collection of interesting links/articles and tools from the world of Python and beyond every week to your email.
10. python-awesome, django-awesome, fastapi-awesome <- repos on GitHub that collect a list of popular, proven, and interesting projects that will often make your life easier.
11. Remote - Jason Fried <- about remote work, which today is an integral element.
12. [Blog: The Pragmatic Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/)

Resources that broaden horizons but can be read a bit later:

1. Zrozumienie Programowania (Understanding Programming) - Gynvael Coldwind <- if you think you've touched on low-level fundamentals in this book, read the above. An exceptionally valuable position, but I'd mark it as optional because it's not easy and you can get discouraged. However, it's worth working through this volume. I also recommend Gynvael's other work, a very inspiring and well-known figure on the scene.
2. The Pragmatic Programmer - Thomas Hunt <- what can I say. A classic.
3. Web Application Security - various authors <- Great book about security in the context of web applications from world-class experts.
4. Modern Software Engineering - David Farley <- About modern ways of software development.
5. Extreme Programming - Kent Beck <- A bit about what the software delivery process looks like and collaboration methods.
6. Deep Work - Cal Newport <- about focused work.

As for practice, stay tuned - I should release a set of exercises soon that's worth working through to gain some practice. Check my blog/LinkedIn.

I believe that if you diligently read and work through the materials above, you'll gain solid knowledge allowing you to start applying for jobs. However, it's required that you actually independently do the exercises, read with understanding, create analogies and comparisons, be able to speak on a given topic. Additionally, I'll note that I know some exercises currently may seem trivial, but still, do them. The point is to get you as accustomed as possible to writing code and familiarize you with Python's standard library.

## This Is The End, There's Nothing More

Yup. Thank you for reading and good luck. For those who purchased this book, I offer a small bonus. If you need advice on something, you can reach out to me. I'll try to help.

Email: olafgorski@pm.me
GitHub: @grski

Feel free to reach out with questions about careers or maybe with a request to conduct a mock interview. I don't promise I'll help everyone, but I'll try as much as I can. I'll also honestly assess your knowledge and give feedback if needed.

I might try to recommend the more capable ones somewhere. Who knows.

Remember that someone helped me too once, and I want to pass the baton forward. This means that I'm just a person, not who knows who. If you write to me, relax, I don't bite. I'll try to help as best I can.

Don't forget about https://github.com/grski/junior-python-exercises where by making pull requests to the repository you can get additional tips plus it will always be something that enriches your GitHub with contributions ;)

Thank you for reading.

That's all from me, have a nice day and bye.
