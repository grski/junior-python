# Culture

A few words about programmer work culture. About attitude and such things. Although seemingly secondary matters, some of them actually play a very important role in the software development process.

## A Bit About Managers/Leaders

A good manager/team leader is a person who can either drive a team to ruin or give it wings. Teams are the basic building blocks of companies. If a manager can destroy or elevate a team, they can do the same to an entire company. This underscores how important it is to have someone normal in a leadership role. How does one elevate or destroy? By operating on what the team consists of. People. A person is the basic and most important unit in a company, whose willingness, and mainly generated unwillingness to work, is heavily dependent on the influence of leaders. I'll describe some of my thoughts related to this, or rather observations about the path that some people take and how it changes them in the end.

On my programming journey, I've met many managers in many different companies. Some were wonderful, positively influenced my life, others were complete idiots, and still others are now almost like family to me. After some time, I started noticing certain patterns that occurred almost always, which allowed me to isolate three boundary levels of being a manager.

### Level One: The Excel Master

Excel Masters are often freshly minted managers, leaders who don't have much experience yet, but are full of ego, pride, and bravado. The world is open to them and ready to be conquered! They love their spreadsheets, record everything in them, optimize, sometimes engage in micromanagement. These are people in the early period of their managerial career, where one can get a bit intoxicated by their power initially.

This type of person often sees only one thing: money. Oh, I used to meet such people too often, for a while, too often. Greedy ones. And they are precisely the most dangerous type of manager that can happen to a company, among the three I've mentioned.

On the surface, Excel Masters look pretty okay. The numbers add up, plans, presentations, it's a fairy tale. But not quite. In reality, everything's falling apart. Why are they the most dangerous type? Because of the facade they put up - they're not usually the ones suspected of being the source of the problem, but after getting to know this species, in the future it's hard not to see them, and then you often recognize them easily. How? Simply find the most unhappy team in the company. A silent team that remains in quiet resignation, seemingly for some elusive reason. Don't look for the team that complains. They still have hope. Look for something else.

Teams that complain - still have the desire to do at least one thing - complain, grumble. True failure and resignation occur when there's nothing, when people are quiet, when they're so tired of everything that they prefer to stay quiet and pretend everything's fine, but unfortunately then it's so bad that even from the outside, upon closer inspection, you can see what the truth is. When enemies argue about something or bicker, that's not yet a fight, but a conversation, they're communicating in some way, it's some form of communication. Real fighting and drama begin when any form of communication ceases and actions appear, deeds and action appear. Deadlines aren't met, projects don't deliver. Often team turnover is also very high. People either get tangled up in such a team out of resignation and simply stay there for a very long time, rotting in the lowlands of despair, or they escape immediately. Usually at the top of such a team, you'll find what I call a Level One Manager - The Excel Master.

Excel Masters see only numbers, only money. They never admit to a mistake, never think they made an error - it's always someone else or the team that's at fault. They don't see people, they don't see team members, they see resources. Resources that can be utilized, or rather I'd say exploited, that can be "optimized". There's nothing more. Like simple math. If you have an 80-hour task, it'll take about two weeks of one programmer's work, if you hire two programmers, it'll take a week, right? Everyone always works at a very constant pace, regardless of context and situation, right? Private life has no impact at all on professional life, right? Margin and profits are all that matters, right? Do these numbers look good? If so, everything's going as it should, right? RIGHT?! Technically yes. Practically no.

A manager like this destroys spirit. They destroy the people who make up the team.

Without people, you don't have a team. Without people, your product won't launch. Without people, deadlines won't be met, but they don't see that. Resources are just that. Resources. At least in their heads.

This is simply crazy and destructive. Nothing worse than feeling unappreciated, than feeling that you're just a cog in a big damn machine that can be replaced with one wave of a manager's hand. Let's not kid ourselves, in reality that's how it is sometimes, although each of us isn't THAT special, or at least partially, but damn, leaders and managers are there to make that feeling disappear. At least partially.

I've met many such people. They have one thing in common. The turmoil they produce.

The best that Level One managers can achieve is very short-term projects. Projects where people don't have a chance to get to know each other, encounter difficulties and real challenges. I'd say a few weeks maximum. This is possible at level one because in such a short time they can't sufficiently destroy their team members. They can't attack them to a state of despair, unless they're very talented at it.

Usually these people either remain locked in this mindset for a loooooong time or they'll try different advice to maybe improve or fix the team, because they often don't see the error in their behavior. Anyway.

Usually this leads to learning about empathy. Which brings us to...

### Level Two: The Empathetic Excel Acolyte

Here things get a bit interesting, I'd say. A person who has reached this level is in an interesting place. Usually driven by constant failures and striving to improve their spreadsheet, team performance, and other VERY IMPORTANT CORPORATE METRICS, they learn about empathy. Oh yes! EMPATHY! That thing we should promote so people feel better, more connected to the team and company, so they seem to perform better? Sounds good, right?

Hell no. This is the problem with Level Two managers. They see empathy only as a tool, a tool to force the team to work. Or to perform better. Anyway, it's not real empathy in any way. It's just calculated manipulation in reality.

Don't get me wrong - a true leader SHOULD and MUST know a bit about manipulation, it should be natural to them, but they shouldn't abuse it. Good managers should be able to read people and their emotions, but never use it against them, never manipulate their team to accomplish certain things. It doesn't work in the long run, but it can sometimes bring short-term benefits. Which is pointless.

This skill should be used for compassion, knowing when to back off, giving a team member some slack sometimes, for various reasons you've observed.

So while the Level Two manager is a bit better than the first, they're still bad, at least they try and pretend. That's something, right? What pretending and what fake empathy am I talking about?

Oh, hi Susan. Nice job at the empathy workshop with our Agile coach last week. It's very important to promote empathy in our company! Your mom died yesterday, so you'd like to leave early today? Oh, not that kind of empathy. Maybe another workshop with the Agile/Empathy coach will help you improve that? The company will pay for it! Think about it Susan and keep it up, champ!

Something like that, I'd say. It's a bit hard to describe, but you can feel and notice it most of the time. This is when you feel like cattle being taken care of by a not-so-great owner who doesn't love his animals, he just does the bare minimum so they have acceptable quality meat. Yeah, something like that.

This is Level Two. Although still better than Level One, it's also a threat, just a smaller one. This one is a bit harder to spot on the surface, but after talking to them a bit, you can also get it.

Level Two can actually deliver some projects. At most short and medium-range ones. Maybe a few months, probably at most half a year. During this period, the facade can still be maintained, pretended, so the team can still be okay, will even achieve nice results. But it's a trap when you hit a longer project where people really get to know each other or have worked together before. That's where they ultimately fail. Sometimes crushingly. There aren't many things worse than the feeling when you realize that your manager/leader was a Level Two. That you were cared for only to perform better, manipulated. Resentment follows bitterness, a sense of betrayal.

Back to the topic - long-term projects. Now this is where the real challenge and fun comes in, and with it comes....

### Level Three: The Human

Usually Level Three is Level One or Two who has simply failed enough times, who has been broken enough times and pieced back together by the passage of time and self-reflection. Rarely is it the genius type who was simply born to be a leader/manager.

In most cases, threes have experienced failure and total, crushing defeat many times in their lives. They're aware that we're just humans and nothing more. And people, on some levels, are extremely tough and resilient, but sometimes they can be so brittle and delicate that even the slightest thing can cause them to shatter to pieces. How do they know? Because they've been there.

They also know that even if you're broken, you can be whole again. Even if you shatter, you can be rebuilt. The same goes for a team.

These are the managers who truly care about you, whom you'll befriend and genuinely like.

Why do I consider them so important? Because if you have a sincere bond with them, and they have a sincere bond with you, your partnership, your teamwork will simply be better. When there's mutual trust and understanding throughout the team, magical things happen. There's no need for micromanagement. Work just starts happening because people are willing to do it, happy to come to work.

Even if what you're working on is complete garbage, at least you have each other, right? You know your manager has your back and your team's back. You know it's not just about KPIs and your performance. Which ironically makes you perform better.

It's just a simple but very deep and meaningful act of seeing you for who you are - a human, not a cog in a machine. It sounds so simple, yet sometimes it takes years to reach this level and it's difficult. It is. People are complicated beings.

How do you recognize Level Three? They're not afraid of their failures, they can be truly vulnerable and show their weak side, share, make you open up a bit and relate. They have very good relationships with their team and know the people who work under them. That's a bad word. They don't have people who work under them. They have people who work with them. That's one of the bigger differences here. Being a manager and having a partnership with the team to achieve a common goal versus having a team of slaves that you manage.

I don't know what else to say here. These are simply truly empathetic people who, by not focusing on improving the show, improved it just by that act. A bit ironically.

How well do you know your teammates? When was the last time you did something nice for the people you work with? Do you all feel safe in your workplace/team? These levels don't just apply to managers or leaders. They can apply to almost anyone, and everyone ultimately influences what level of manager you get.

A manager manages a team/project, but the team also teaches the manager many things. It's a two-way relationship. You're a wave - influencing other waves around you, so... Think about it for a while.

Now stop for a moment and ask yourself this question: which one are you?

In summary. Stop focusing so much on KPIs, Excel sheets, Performance data. Focus on the people you work with, see them for who they are - people, not resources or numbers in Excel sheets. Get to know them, their strengths and weaknesses.

A good general knows where to assign a specific soldier based on their character, a good carpenter knows where to use a given piece of wood based on its characteristics. A good manager is the same. It's for everyone's benefit. Be a good manager. Be empathetic. Focus on people. That's it.

We've all been there. If you're currently at Level One, or Two, don't worry. It's part of the process. I'm not a three either. Heck, I'm not even a manager myself, so what do I know!

## Design Culture

An important and essential element of every piece of code or system you create is its design. What does this specifically mean?

It's about making sure the code you write is **thought through**. This is where something we call `incremental design` comes in. It means that generally, you can't immediately create an ideal solution for projects less trivial than Hello World. Instead, you have to think about delivering a solution as a process that we go through step by step.

First, we should understand the given problem, grasp it well, and put it into our brain to process into analogies and concepts understandable to us.

Mistakes and being wrong are part of this process. Get used to it. Almost never will your first idea for solving a problem be complete or correct. Instead, it's worth breaking the problem down into tiny pieces that, with their triviality, will approach the aforementioned Hello World. Of course, you need to have taste and intuition here, because you can't break things down too much either.

Where's the boundary? The intuition, in my opinion, will come with time and practice.

Something I recommend from my own experience is the following steps:

1. Understanding the problem and asking questions. This is the place for reflection, analogies, and trying to familiarize yourself with the given problem. Ask, even about seemingly stupid things, understand what's going on here and what the problem is. Understand the **domain** of the problem and **model** it somehow in your head. What does that mean? Present and imagine an abstract concept in a somewhat less abstract, understandable way for yourself.
2. Draw out the concept from the point above or summarize your thoughts in written form. This is where you should confront your ideas with reality, ask the right people if that's what was meant. Diagrams are incredibly useful here. Note, however, that this isn't about a detailed implementation plan or anything like that. No. A general outline of what the problem is about.
3. Only now is it time for the first implementations of the smallest pieces. A task divided into small parts is a task easy to handle. A small piece is easier to handle at once than a huge problem. Maybe apply TDD now? Write a piece of code that reflects the model and some piece of the solution to the problem, test and confront with reality. It's worth noting here that code should be written so that it's as easy as possible to change, replace, or refactor later. The more complicated and connected to other fragments the code is, the harder it is to edit and refactor. However, this is not an encouragement to create a huge monstrosity that will contain tons of boilerplate code and do everything while doing nothing. Nothing could be further from the truth.
4. Having something in hand that sensibly actually solves the problem and well reflects the model of the problem, now you can refactor a bit, improve, tighten up, make the code easier and better written.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as needed. Maybe step 2 as well.

I'm not encouraging you to immediately create a **waterfall** model from the top, where we plan everything in detail upfront.

Iteration by iteration we improve our design and code, moving forward. That's what it's all about. Thanks to this, we can test tiny pieces, validate our ideas on an ongoing basis (e.g., with the client by delivering tiny fragments, but often) and live with bearable code.

Programming paradoxically, if done well, often doesn't rely on programming.

The most time should be spent analyzing the problem and thinking, planning. Changing a concept is easy, it's just a thought or diagram. It's a relatively cheap operation. Changing code, on the other hand, is often expensive. Your task is to always **think** and keep various considerations in mind.

![Tom Scott - meme. I took the liberty of using the image, I hope it doesn't bother anyone.](./chapters/resources/images/future_me.jpg)

Situations like in the meme above can be unpleasant. Remember that in the future, you'll probably be maintaining your own code, at least for a while. Do yourself a favor from the future and think twice about the code you write, put in the effort. It's not worth being sloppy and lazy sometimes. Paradoxically, it's the lazy ones who think the most, because it's easier to think than to type code. So let's follow the path of a true, not pretend, lazy person and take care of design. A well-designed application can be rewarding to work with for both the programmer and the end user.

Sometimes it's enough to spend an hour thinking to save yourself 4-8 hours of coding.

By the way, don't be afraid that someone will hold you accountable for conceptual work by counting the lines of code you produced. That's not what creative work is about. No sensible employer will hold you accountable for writing 20 lines instead of 40. The number of lines of spewed code is no measure. Of course, I'm not talking about extremes, when you're a junior and throughout the whole month you added one commit changing one line, which probably means you're taking someone for a fool.

## About Values

Supposedly, those who don't have values and principles talk about them the most, because the rest just live by them. Despite this folk wisdom, I'll write a bit about them, but only gently. I'd still like to mention certain values that guide me at work and that I personally like to see in myself and others. These traits are something I believe form the foundation of a good programmer, coder, employee.

1. Honesty and open mind
   This is fundamental for everyone. People have problems talking to each other honestly and with communication. Every relationship should be based on honesty, especially professional ones. This requires an open mind and putting ego in your pocket.
2. Respect
   Have respect for other people, clients, coworkers. Respect their time, knowledge, and money. This way you can build relationships for years. Above all, respect yourself, because if you don't respect yourself, it's hard for others to do so.
3. Empathy and being human
   At the end of the day, we're just humans. Put yourself in someone else's shoes sometimes before you say something. A good atmosphere and trust built on empathy and sympathy for another person allows the team to achieve synergy that will incredibly improve and make work more pleasant. Be human. Don't be a jerk.
4. Taking responsibility and being proud of your work
   When you create something, take responsibility for it, be proud of it. This principle has far-reaching implications like caring for your code, delivering holistic solutions that have been tested, sometimes `going the extra mile` if needed, having and showing initiative instead of blindly following tasks.
5. Meritocracy
   In my opinion, we put ego in our pocket. Critique, meritocratic that is, of your solution, code, or even yourself, don't take personally and as an attack. No. These are rather valuable lessons from which you can learn, you just need to push ego to the background and focus on what's important, which is the good of the project, the client, delivering value. It doesn't mean you have to constantly sacrifice yourself, no. Respect yourself above all, but I repeat. We put ego in our pocket and try to base things at work on logic, arguments, and discussions conducted in an adult manner. Additionally, I'd also like to mention that you shouldn't be afraid to propose your solutions, even if they somewhat contradict the solutions of, say, a leader, senior programmer, or client. If you work with the right people, they'll appreciate it and you'll choose a solution based on facts, not other factors.
6. Collaboration
   Be independent in your work locally, but oriented toward collaboration globally. What does that mean? Think and keep a broader perspective in the back of your mind and try to coordinate your individual efforts so they fit into some broader plan. An example here is: "I'll start implementing this task first, because it will unblock the frontend."
7. Assume good intentions
   When in doubt, ask. That's the short version. If you're working with someone, it means they probably went through similar verification as you. It means they're somehow competent, that's my assumption. On top of that, I assume, unless facts have proven otherwise, that everyone on the team has good intentions. So before I do something, if I have even a shadow of doubt about the nature of the situation, I prefer to ask what someone meant. Maybe a bad day, maybe I misunderstood something, maybe someone's spouse gave them a hard time in the morning. Who knows.

I believe that following these points above won't hurt you. It's worth keeping them in the back of your mind. Because in IT, it's often not about IT but about people and their problems. If you think about it, that's what you're paid for - solving business problems, problems of specific people, making their lives easier. That's what the big bucks are paid for. Delivering value. And that requires having the right traits and understanding, being a certain kind of person. I think the attributes above are ones that will allow you to shine in a team as well as a company. These are the basics of being a normal person, although sometimes rarely encountered. Stand out not only with hard IT skills, but also by being a good person.

Damn, that's poetic and bombastic.

## Kaizen

I'd like to say a few words about the Kaizen philosophy. What does it mean? It's a Japanese concept whose main theme is continuous, ongoing work on yourself and making small improvements that together add up to something bigger.

Generally, this works very well in our profession and actually everywhere.

Every day we should make the code a little bit better by adding new features or improving existing ones. Every day we should read at least a little bit, learn something new. After some time, compound interest starts working here and it turns out that from this daily, small effort, something huge grows. 1% daily gives 3700% annually when accounting for compound interest. Mind-blowing.

So Kaizen or The Slight Edge is something that should be present in your work culture.

## Managing Your Investment Portfolio

Mysterious heading. What's it about? Namely, that each of us invests in life, even if we don't play the stock market. How so? Yes. You yourself are your greatest investment. Your knowledge, career, life.

Knowledge is very valuable. It's something you should constantly invest in, because it usually gives huge returns.

## Report from Leading My First Retrospective

I recently had the opportunity to facilitate a retrospective for the first time in my life; this will be my summary of that experience.

The idea started when one of the founders of the company I was working for at the time asked me if I'd like to do it.

Me - an agile/scrum-skeptic/whatever-skeptic, leading a retrospective? Sounds like a recipe for disaster.

Well, I agreed without hesitation. Despite the fact that for the most part I'm not a big fan of all the current hype around agile, scrum slaves (I love this term and often overuse it), and so on, additionally one pleasant thing that comes to mind when I hear retrospective is a Jinjer song. But seriously - either it's just me, or some people have gone crazy inventing more and more extreme and weird practices when it comes to ~AGILE~, which don't bring much effect beyond annoying developers and wasting business people's time.

Anyway - seeing a lot of such hype, I immediately become skeptical. Hence I decided to check what's on the other side of the fence.

Of course, I was aware that there are many valuable practices, things, habits, and thinking patterns that can be learned from the Agile crowd, it's not like I'm saying everything agile is useless. Don't interpret my words that way. It's just that some people do crazy things that aren't Agile and call them Agile. That sometimes leads to madness. I've seen it with my own eyes, no psychotherapist helped afterward. I'm digressing.

Since it was my first time, I was offered help. The company arranged a few hours for me with our friendly agile coach who helps us build certain processes in the company. We had a short conversation before I planned my retrospective.

I learned a bit about setting the stage, gathering data, insights, cool tools to use, and so on. This quick session, despite my initial doubts about it, helped me quite a bit. So big thanks here and shout out to Marcin Konkel!

### Ready, Set, Go
And so the day and hour came. The meeting started. I got nervous when we were all in place. If it weren't for the fact that this was my first retrospective, it was because of the way we work, and we work 100% remotely, it was a remote retrospective. Personally, I think remote communication is harder - you have to be more precise, accurate, more communicative and attentive. It takes some time and skill to get used to it.

### Setting the Stage
Before we started, I decided to establish a few clear rules and say my assumptions out loud, which were: We don't interrupt each other while talking. Given how we're conducting the retrospective remotely, we have to stick to this even more than ever. If you have something to add outside of your turn/speaking time, raise your hand to the camera. The speaker or moderator should notice and give you a chance. The first person to speak in a given round for a given exercise is chosen by the facilitator. That person gets some time to answer the question while others listen. After finishing speaking, they point to the next person who should speak. After we established these rules, I mentioned one thing.

This was a retrospective for our team. I'm part of this team, I actively participate in development and work. Today, however, I was playing the role of moderator. I was nothing more. Therefore, I clearly noted that today I'm doing just that - facilitating. Monitor, manage, facilitate, and moderate conversations. Let them do the rest.

Furthermore, I'm a bit of a direct guy - instead of using any fancy tools, I just went with conversation. No post-it notes. No boards. Just our faces, voices, and me quietly taking notes of the whole retro in the background. Yes - scary that you actually have to talk to people. Ugh.

### Warm-up
Initially, I wanted to lighten the mood a bit, get people talking, because I was perfectly aware of what they were feeling at that moment. Some of them had been interrupted in the middle of work, thrown out of flow, to participate in this meeting. They're in a different context now, so it was time to bring them here, to this moment.

How to do it? I asked everyone a simple question.

What, whether in private or professional life, has made you happy recently?

This allowed the team to get a new, small look at each other. Maybe find a new way of looking at each other. I know it sounds simple, but that's exactly what it was in reality. Everyone surprisingly shared happy little moments from their private lives and you know what? I felt it strengthened the bonds that connect us all as a team.

### Past Retrospective
Before this one, we conducted another retrospective in the past with a different agile coach, as a result of which we declared several goals. Now it was time to check them. So I asked each person who had a defined goal about the status of their goal, how it's going, and what their opinion is, experiences so far.

All people agreed that the previous goals were needed, are done or in progress, and somehow improved our work. Nice.

### Goodies - Gathering Data
We work in a very multicultural and international team, and yet somehow it turned out that only team members from one nationality were at this retrospective. Being from the same nationality myself, I know about our quirks, and one of them is complaining. It's like hyperinflation, once it starts, there's no turning back.

To set the right atmosphere, I decided to talk about good things first, to put people in a good mood. I asked them all a question:

What are certain things that you think we do that make us deliver faster, better, and generally contribute to us doing better work, or what are you recently satisfied with?

Here everyone shared their perspective, observations, and so on.

### Baddies - Gathering Data
So, while they were still in good moods and the aura was positive, I dropped the bomb that sometimes opens the gates of hell at retrospectives - what went wrong? Let's get specific. Enough sugarcoating. Straight up.

And so the complaining began. Or so I thought - that it would start. Instead, it didn't start.

I asked a question:

> What do you think we did wrong recently? What did you observe that makes us deliver less, slower? What makes your work less pleasant?

Instead of mindless babble, the team did something nice. They presented constructive and wise insights, observations, and comments. Honestly, it was quite amazing. Sometimes I'm surprised by how smart the people I work with are.

### Happies - Still Gathering Data
Since I like to change moods like a sine function changes its value, I changed the topic again.

This time I decided to facilitate a conversation about things we do that make them happy. It was a different question than the first - the good things we do - because here it wasn't about delivery, productivity, and generating value. It was about human bonds and how we behave toward each other, how we interact. I thought it would be nice if they told each other what they notice in others' behavior and what they appreciate.

I don't know about you, but I like getting a pat on the back sometimes - a sign that someone appreciates my efforts.

So:

> What do you appreciate that we do? Not in the aspect of productivity, coding, or technicality, but just as a person - what makes you want to be with us and spend our time together?

And this one, oh man, this point was quite sweet honestly. So if we had sweet, it's time for bitter again.

### Stop, It Hurts.
Now I decided to stir the waters a bit. I threw in a topic:

> Goals for improvement. What should we stop doing? What should we achieve to improve?

And here I decided that this retrospective shouldn't end with just empty talk. I mean, yes, sure, we improved bonds a bit, got to know each other a bit better and had a blast talking to each other (really!), but for me that's not enough.

So I threw in an idea.

Everyone, if they wished, could voluntarily choose one or more tasks, their pain points, that they want to solve by the next retrospective.

Besides, they also had to choose a ~~witcher~~ watcher for their tasks. Maybe owner would be a better word here. This person will be responsible for checking their progress and so on. Basically someone who will make sure the task gets done, besides that person. Someone who will nag them a bit, e.g., every other day asking the famous, at least in our company, question - What's the status here?

Why? While I trust my teammates to fully accomplish project-related things, these tasks were in the nice-to-do category and all that, but we won't die if we don't do them. They weren't critical, just nice to do. Hence it would be good to have some accountability and extra motivation to do them.

That also worked - almost everyone decided on some tasks for themselves.

### Inception
After that, it was time for a little inception. A retrospective on the retrospective. Basically a short round of feedback about today's retrospective, my facilitation, generated value, and so on. They supposedly liked it, or so they said. Yeah.

That would be about it. After that, the retrospective came to an end. I survived and actually found it meaningful. But on the other hand, quite demanding.

I'm young, I have a problem with my ego, you know. It was hard to be on the sidelines, just observing most of the time, being a moderator instead of an active participant. I had a few moments where I wanted to drop my moderator role and engage as a team member, starting my endless chatter, throwing in my two cents, but I held back from that, I managed to stay in my role.

It was a bit humbling and satisfying, honestly.

### Summary

Just so you know, later those tasks we defined - they got done. So it didn't actually end with just empty talk. Supposedly the idea with guardians for tasks also helped a bit - maybe it'll be useful to you too? I have no idea.

So well, Agile processes can also be fun and useful, that's the first thing. Second, show empathy and check the other side of the fence if you have a specific opinion or maybe you strongly disagree with someone about something, try to understand. Maybe there's something valuable there, you just don't know about it. Finally, get out of your comfort zone. That's how you'll grow. Full-on coaching. Who stole your dreams?

If you're also preparing for your first retro, maybe this article will be helpful to you. Additionally: protip. Take notes. I did. Later, after the retro, I turned them into a nice Confluence page and Jira tasks.

That would be it for today, I, Olaf, was your humble host, I hope you enjoyed it.
