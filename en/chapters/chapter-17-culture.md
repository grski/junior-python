# Culture

A few words about the culture of a programmer's work. About attitude and such. While seemingly secondary matters, some of them actually play a very important role in the software development process.

## A Bit About Managers/Leaders

A good manager/team leader is someone who can either lead a team to ruin or give them wings. Teams are the basic building blocks of companies. If a manager can destroy or empower a team, they can do the same to the entire company. This emphasizes how important it is to have someone normal in a leadership role. How does one empower or destroy? By operating on what the team consists of. On people. A person is the basic and most important unit in a company, whose willingness, and mainly generated unwillingness to work, is strongly dependent on the influence of leaders. I'll describe some of my thoughts on this, or rather observations about the path that some go through and how it changes them in effect.

On my programming path, I've met many managers in many different companies. Some were wonderful, positively influencing my life, others were complete idiots, and yet others are now almost like family to me. After some time, I started noticing certain patterns that occurred almost always, which allowed me to isolate three boundary levels of being a manager.

### Level One: Excel Master

Excel Masters are often freshly minted managers, leaders who don't have much experience yet, but are full of ego, pride, and bravado. The world is open before them and ready to be conquered! They love their spreadsheets, record everything in them, optimize, sometimes practice micromanagement. These are people in the early period of their managerial career, where one can get a bit intoxicated by their power initially.

This type of person often sees only one thing: money. Oh, I've met too many of these until a certain point, way too many. Money-grubbers. And they are precisely the most dangerous type of manager that can happen to a company, among the three I've mentioned.

Superficially, Excel Masters look quite good. The numbers add up, plans, presentations, it's a dream. But not quite. In reality, everything falls apart. Why are they the most dangerous type? Because of the facade they impose - they're not the ones usually suspected of being the source of problems, but after getting to know this species, it's hard not to notice them in the future, and you can often recognize them easily. How? Just find the most unhappy team in the company. A silent team that persists in quiet resignation, seemingly for some elusive reason. Don't look for a team that complains. They still have hope. Look for something else.

Teams that complain - they still have the desire to do at least one thing - complain, grumble. True failure and resignation occur when there's nothing, when people are quiet, when they're so tired of everything that they prefer to remain silent and pretend everything is fine, but unfortunately, it's so bad that even from the outside, upon closer inspection, you can see the truth. When enemies argue about something or banter, that's not yet a fight, but a conversation, they're talking in a way, it's some form of communication. The real fight and drama begin when any form of communication ceases and actions appear, deeds and action. Deadlines aren't met, projects don't succeed. Often, team turnover is also very high. People either get entangled in such a team out of resignation and simply stay there for a very long time, rotting in the depths of despair, or they flee immediately. Usually at the top of such a team, you'll find what I call a Level One Manager - Excel Master.

Excel Masters see only numbers, only money. They never admit to a mistake, never think they made a mistake - it's always someone else or the team that's at fault. They don't see people, they don't see team colleagues, they see resources. Resources that can be utilized, or rather exploited, that can be "optimized". There's nothing more. Like simple mathematics. If you have a task for 80 hours, it will take about two weeks of work by one programmer, if you hire two programmers, it will take a week, right? Everyone always performs work at a very steady pace, regardless of context and situation, right? Private life has no influence on professional life at all, right? Margin and profits are all that matter, right? Do these numbers look good? If yes, then everything is going as it should, right? RIGHT?! Technically yes. Practically no.

A manager like this destroys the spirit. They destroy the people who make up the team.

Without people, you don't have a team. Without people, your product won't be launched. Without people, deadlines won't be met, but they don't see this. Resources are just that. Resources. At least in their heads.

This is simply insane and destructive. Nothing worse than feeling unappreciated, than feeling you're just a cog in a big damn machine that can be replaced with one wave of the manager's hand. Let's not kid ourselves, in reality, it's sometimes like that, although each of us isn't THAT special, or at least partially, but damn, leaders and managers are there to make that feeling disappear. At least partially.

I've met many such people. They have one thing in common. The havoc they produce.

The best that Level One managers can achieve is very short-term projects. Projects where people don't have a chance to get to know each other, encounter difficulties and real challenges. I'd say a maximum of a few weeks. This is possible from level one because in such a short time, they can't destroy their team members enough. They can't attack them to the state of despair, unless they're very talented at it.

Usually, these people either remain locked in this attitude for a loooooong time or try various pieces of advice to maybe improve or fix the team, because they often don't see the error in their behavior. In any case.

This usually leads to learning about empathy. Which brings us to...

### Level Two: Empathetic Excel Acolyte

Here things get a bit interesting, I'd say. A person who has reached this level is in an interesting place. Usually driven by constant failures and striving to improve their spreadsheet, team performance, and other VERY IMPORTANT CORPORATE INDICATORS, they learn about empathy. Oh yes! EMPATHY! What we should promote to make people feel better, more connected to the team and company, so they seem to perform better? Sounds good, right?

Hell no. This is the problem with Level Two managers. They see empathy only as a tool, a tool to force the team to work. Or to better performance. In any case, this is not true empathy in any way. It's just calculated manipulation in reality.

Don't get me wrong - a true leader SHOULD and MUST know a bit about manipulation, it should be natural for them, but they shouldn't abuse it. Good managers should be able to read people and their emotions, but never use this against them, never manipulate their team to perform certain things. This doesn't work in the long run, but can sometimes bring short-term benefits. Which is pointless.

This skill should be used for compassion, knowing when to back off, give a team member some slack sometimes, for various reasons you've observed.

So although a Level Two manager is a bit better than Level One, they're still bad, at least they try and pretend. That's something, right? What kind of pretending and what kind of pretended empathy am I talking about here?

Oh, hi Susan. Good job at the empathy workshop with our Agile trainer last week. It's very important to promote empathy in our company! Your mom died yesterday, so you'd like to leave early today? Oh, not that kind of empathy. Maybe another workshop with the Agile/Empathy trainer will help you improve that? The company will pay for it! Think about it Susan and keep it up, champ!

Something like that I'd say. It's a bit hard to describe, but you can feel and notice it most of the time. It's when you feel like cattle being taken care of by not so great an owner who doesn't love their animals, they just do the bare minimum so they have meat of acceptable quality. Yeah, something like that.

This is Level Two. Although still better than Level One, it's also a threat, just a smaller one. This one is a bit harder to notice on the surface, but after talking with them a bit, you can also get it.

Level Two can actually deliver some projects. At most short- and medium-distance ones. Maybe a few months, probably at most half a year. In this period, you can still maintain the facade, pretend, so the team can still be okay, will even achieve nice results. But this is a trap when you get a longer project, where people really get to know each other or have worked together before. This is where they ultimately fail. Sometimes crushingly. There aren't many things worse than the feeling when you realize your manager/leader was a Level Two. That they cared about you only to make you perform better, manipulated you. Resentment follows bitterness, a sense of betrayal.

Back to the topic - long-term projects. Now this is where the real challenge and fun comes in, and with it enters...

### Level Three: Human

Usually, Level Three is Level One or Two who has simply failed enough times, who has been broken enough times and put back together by the passage of time and self-reflection. Rarely is it a genius type who was just born to be a leader/manager.

In most cases, Threes have experienced many times in their life failure and total, crushing defeat. They're aware that we're just humans and nothing more. And humans, on some levels, are extremely tough and resilient, but sometimes can be so brittle and delicate that even the smallest thing can make them shatter into pieces. How do they know? Because they've been there.

They also know that even if you're broken, you can be whole again. Even if you shatter, you can be rebuilt. The same goes for the team.

These are managers who truly care about you, who you'll befriend and genuinely like.

Why do I consider them so important? Because if you have a sincere bond with them, and they have a sincere bond with you, your partnership, your teamwork will simply be better. When there's shared trust and understanding throughout the whole team, magical things happen. There's no need for micromanagement. Work just starts happening because people are willing to do it, happy to come to work.

Even if what you're working on is total garbage, at least you have each other, right? You know your manager has your back and your team's back. You know it's not just about KPIs and your results. Which ironically makes you perform better.

It's just a simple, but very deep and meaningful act of seeing you as you are - a human, not a cog in a machine. It sounds so simple, and yet sometimes reaching this level takes years and is difficult. That's how it is. People are complicated beings.

How to recognize Level Three? They're not afraid of their failures, they can be truly sensitive and show their weak side, share, make you open up a bit and relate. They have very good relationships with their team and know the people who work under them. That's the wrong word. They don't have people who work under them. They have people who work with them. That's one of the bigger differences here. Being a manager and having a partnership with the team to achieve a common goal versus having a team of slaves to manage.

I don't know what else to say here. These are simply truly empathetic people who, by not focusing on improving the performance, improved it only by this act. A bit ironically.

How well do you know your team colleagues? When was the last time you did something nice for the people you work with? Do you all feel safe at work/in the team? These levels don't only apply to managers or leaders. They can apply to almost anyone, and everyone ultimately influences what kind of manager you get.

A manager manages the team/project, but the team also teaches the manager many things. It's a two-way relationship. You're a wave - influencing other waves around you, so... Think about it for a while.

Now stop for a moment and ask yourself this question: which one are you?

To sum up. Stop focusing so much on KPIs, Excel spreadsheets, Performance data. Focus on the people you work with, see them as they are - humans, not resources or numbers in Excel spreadsheets. Get to know them, their strengths and weaknesses.

A good general knows where to assign a specific soldier based on their character, a good carpenter knows where to use a specific piece of wood based on its characteristics. A good manager is the same. It's to everyone's benefit. Be a good manager. Be empathetic. Focus on people. That's it.

We've all been there. If you're currently at Level One, or Two, don't worry. It's part of the process. I'm not a Three either. Heck, I'm not even a manager myself, so what do I know!

## Design Culture

An important and essential element of any piece of code or system you create is its design. What does this specifically mean?

Well, it's about making the code you write **thoughtful**. This is where something called `incremental design` comes in. This means that generally, for projects less trivial than Hello World, you can't create a perfect solution right away. Instead, you need to think of delivering a solution as a process we go through step by step.

First, we should understand the given problem, grasp it well, and throw it into our brain to process it into analogies and concepts understandable to us.

Mistakes and being wrong are part of this process. Get used to it. Almost never will your first idea for solving a problem be complete or correct. Instead, it's worth breaking the problem into tiny pieces that, in their triviality, will approach the aforementioned Hello World. Of course, you need to have taste and feel here, as you can't break things down too much either.

Where is the boundary? The feel, in my opinion, will come with time and practice.

Something I recommend from myself is the following steps:

1. Understanding the problem and asking questions. This is the place for thoughts, analogies, and trying to get familiar with the given problem. Ask, even about seemingly stupid things, understand what this is about and what the problem is. Understand the problem's **domain** and **model** it in some way in your head. What does this mean? Present an abstract concept and imagine it in a somewhat less abstract, understandable way for yourself.
2. Draw out the concept from the point above or summarize your thoughts in written form. This is where it's worth confronting your imagination with reality, asking the right people if this is what it was about. Diagrams are incredibly useful here. I emphasize, however, that this is not about a detailed implementation plan or something like that. No. A general outline of what the problem is about.
3. Only now is it time for the first implementations of the smallest pieces. A task divided into small parts is a task easy to grasp. A small piece is easier to grasp at once than a huge problem. Maybe apply TDD now? Write some piece of code that reflects the model and some piece of the solution to the problem, test and confront with reality. It's worth noting here that code should be written so that it's as easy as possible to change, replace, refactor later. The more complicated and connected to other fragments the code is, the harder it is to edit and refactor. This is not, however, an encouragement to create a huge monster that will contain tons of boilerplate code and do everything, while doing nothing. Nothing could be further from the truth.
4. Having in hand something that sensibly actually solves the problem and reflects the problem model well, now you can refactor a bit, improve, polish, make the code easier and better written.
5. Steps 3 and 4 we repeat as needed. Maybe also step 2.

I'm not encouraging here to immediately create a **waterfall** model from the top, where we plan everything in detail.

Iteration by iteration we improve our design and code, moving forward. That's what it's about. Thanks to this, we can test tiny pieces, validate our ideas on the fly (e.g., with the client by delivering tiny fragments, but often) and live with bearable code.

Programming, paradoxically, if done well, often doesn't rely on programming.

Well, the most time should be spent analyzing the problem and thinking, planning. Changing a concept is easy, it's just a thought or diagram. It's a relatively cheap operation. Changing code, on the other hand, can often be costly. Your task is to always **think** and keep various considerations in mind.

![Tom Scott - meme. I allowed myself to use the image, I hope it doesn't bother anyone.](./chapters/resources/images/future_me.jpg)

The situation like in the meme above can be unpleasant. Remember that in the future, you'll probably be maintaining your own code, at least for a while. So do yourself a favor and think twice about the code you write, put in the effort. It's not worth being sloppy and lazy sometimes. I mean, paradoxically, it's the lazy ones who think the most, because it's easier to think than to type code. So let's follow the path of the true, not apparent, lazy person and take care of design. A well-designed application can be grateful to work with both for the programmer and the end user.

Sometimes it's enough to spend an hour thinking to save yourself 4-8 hours of typing code.

By the way, don't be afraid that someone will hold you accountable for conceptual work based on counting lines of code you produced. That's not what creative work is about. No sensible employer will hold you accountable for writing 20 lines instead of 40. The number of lines of code produced is not a measure. Of course, I'm not talking about extremes, when you're a junior and for a whole month you added one commit changing one line, which probably means you're pulling someone's leg.

## About Values

Supposedly, those who don't have values and principles talk about them the most, because the rest simply live by them. Despite this folk wisdom, I'll write a bit about them, but only lightly. I'd like to mention certain values that guide me in my work and that I personally like to see in myself and others. These traits are something I consider to be the foundation of a good programmer, coder, employee.

1. Honesty and open mind
   This is the foundation for me in everyone. People have problems talking to each other honestly and with communication. Every relationship, especially professional, should be based on honesty. This requires an open mind and putting ego in your pocket.
2. Respect (street people, you know, keyboard)
   Have respect for another person, client, colleagues. Respect their time, knowledge, and money. This way you can build relationships for years. Also respect yourself first and foremost, because if you don't respect yourself, it's hard for others to do so.
3. Empathy and being human
   At the end of the day, we're just people. Put yourself in someone else's shoes sometimes before saying something. A good atmosphere and trust built on empathy and sympathy for another person allows achieving synergy in the team that will incredibly streamline, but also make work more pleasant. Be human. Don't be a jerk.
4. Taking responsibility and being proud of your work
   When you create something, take responsibility for it, be proud of it. This principle has far-reaching implications like taking care of your code, delivering holistic solutions that have been tested, sometimes `going the extra mile` if needed, having and showing initiative instead of blindly following tasks.
5. Meritocracy
   In my opinion, we put ego in our pocket. Criticism, meritocratic I mean, of your solution, code, or even yourself, don't take personally and as an attack. No. These are rather valuable lessons from which you can learn, you just need to push ego to the background and focus on what's important, that is, the good of the project, client, delivering value. This doesn't mean you have to constantly sacrifice yourself, no. Respect yourself first and foremost, but I repeat. We put ego in our pocket and try to base things at work on logic, arguments, and discussions conducted in an adult manner. Additionally, I'd also like to mention that you shouldn't be afraid to propose your solutions, even if they somewhat contradict solutions of, for example, the leader, senior programmer, or client. If you work with the right people, they'll appreciate it and you'll choose the solution based on facts, not other factors.
6. Collaboration
   Be independent in your work locally, but globally oriented towards collaboration. What does this mean? Think and have somewhere in the back of your mind a broader perspective and try to coordinate your individual efforts so that they fit into some broader plan. An example here is: "I'll start implementing this task first, because this way I'll unblock the frontend."
7. Assume good intentions
   When in doubt, ask. That's it in short. If you work with someone, it means they probably went through similar verification as you. This means they're somewhat competent, that's my assumption. Additionally, I assume, unless facts prove otherwise, that everyone in the team has good intentions. So before I do something, if I have even a shadow of doubt about the nature of the situation, I prefer to ask what someone meant. Maybe a bad day, maybe I misinterpreted something, maybe someone's wife gave them a hard time in the morning. Who knows.

I believe that being guided by these points above won't harm you. It's worth keeping them in the back of your mind. Because in IT, it's often not about IT but about people and their problems. When you think about it, that's what you're paid for - for solving business problems, problems of specific people, making their lives easier. That's what the big bucks are paid for. Delivering value. And this requires having appropriate traits and understanding, being a certain kind of person. I think the attributes above are ones that will allow you to shine in the team and company. These are the basics of being a normal person, although sometimes rarely encountered. Stand out not only with hard IT skills but also with being a good person.

Damn, but poetically and bravely.

## Kaizen

I'd like to say a few words about the Kaizen philosophy. What does this mean? It's a Japanese thought whose main theme is continuous, constant work on yourself and making small improvements that together make up something bigger.

Generally, this works very well in our profession and actually everywhere.

Every day we should make the code a tiny bit better by adding new functionalities or improving existing ones. Every day we should at least read a tiny bit, learn something new. After some time, compound interest starts working here and it turns out that from this daily, small effort, something huge grows. 1% daily gives 3700% yearly after taking into account compound interest. But damn.

So Kaizen or The Slight Edge is something that should be present in your work culture.

## Managing an Investment Portfolio

Mysterious header. What's this about? Namely, that each of us invests in life, even if we don't play the stock market. How so? Yes. You yourself are your biggest investment. Your knowledge, career, life.

Knowledge is very valuable. It's something you should constantly invest in, as it usually gives huge returns.

## Relation from Facilitating the First Retro

Recently, I had the opportunity to facilitate a retrospective for the first time in my life, this will be my summary of this experience.

The idea started when one of the founders of the company I was working for at the time asked me if I'd like to do this.

Me - an agile/scrum-sceptic/whatever-sceptic, facilitating a retrospective? Sounds like a recipe for disaster.

Well, I agreed without hesitation. Despite the fact that for the most part I'm not a big fan of all the current buzz around agile, scrum slaves (I love this term and often overuse it) and so on, additionally one pleasant thing that comes to my mind when I hear retrospective is the Jinjer song. And seriously - either it's just me or some people have gone crazy, coming up with increasingly extreme and strange practices when it comes to ~AGILE~, which don't bring greater effects beyond annoying developers and wasting business people's time.

In any case - seeing a lot of such buzz, I immediately become skeptical. Hence I decided to check what's on the other side of the fence.

Of course, I was aware that there are many valuable practices, things, habits, and thinking patterns that can be learned from the Agile crowd, it's not like I'm saying everything agile is useless. Don't interpret my words that way. It's just that some people do crazy things that aren't Agile and call them Agile. Especially in Poland it seems. And this sometimes leads to madness. I've seen it with my own eyes, no psychotherapist helped later. I digress.

Since this was my first time, I was offered help. The company arranged a few hours with our friendly agile trainer, who helps us in building certain processes in the company. We had a short conversation before I planned my retrospective.

I learned a bit about setting the stage, gathering data, insights, cool tools to use, and so on. This quick session, despite my initial doubts about it, helped me quite a bit. So big thanks here and shout out to Marcin Konkel!

### Ready, set, go
So the day and hour came. The meeting started. I got nervous when we were all in place. If it weren't for the fact that this was my first retrospective, then due to the way we work, and we work 100% remotely, this was a remote retrospective. Personally, I think remote communication is more difficult - you need to be more precise, accurate, more communicative and attentive. It takes some time and skill to get used to it.

### Setting the stage
Before we started, I decided to establish a few clear rules and say out loud my assumptions, which were: We don't interrupt each other during the conversation. Considering how we're conducting the retrospective remotely, we need to stick to this even more than ever. If you have something to add outside your turn/speaking time, raise your hand to the camera. The speaker or moderator should notice this and give you a chance. The first person to speak in a given round for a given exercise is chosen by the facilitator. That person gets some time to answer the question while others listen. After finishing speaking, they point to the next person who should speak. After we established these rules, I mentioned one thing.

This was a retrospective for our team. I'm part of this team, actively participating in development and work. Today, however, I was playing the role of moderator. I was nothing more. So I clearly marked that today I'm doing just that - facilitating. Monitor, manage, facilitate and moderate conversations. Let them do the rest.

Moreover, I'm a bit of a direct guy - instead of using any fancy tools, I just went with conversation. No post-it notes. No boards. Just our faces, voices, and me, quietly noting the whole retro in the background. Yes - terrifying that you actually have to talk to people. Ugh.

### Warm-up
Initially, I wanted to lighten the mood a bit, get people talking, because I was perfectly aware of what they were feeling at that moment. Some of them were interrupted in the middle of work, thrown out of flow, to participate in this meeting. They're now in a different context, so it was time to bring them here, to this moment.

How to do this? I asked everyone a simple question.

What, whether in private or professional life, made you happy recently?

This allowed the team to have a new, small look at each other. Perhaps finding a new way of looking at each other. I know it sounds simple, but that's how it was in reality. Everyone surprisingly shared happy little moments from their private life and you know what? I felt that this strengthened the bonds that connect us all as a team.

### Retrospective in the past
Before this, we conducted another retrospective in the past with another agile trainer, as a result of which we declared several goals. Now it was time to check them. So I asked each person who had a defined goal about the status of their goal, how it's going and their opinion, experiences so far.

All people unanimously stated that the previous goals were needed, are done or in progress and somehow improved our work. Nice.

### Goodies - gathering data
We work in a very multicultural and international team, and yet somehow it turned out that at this retrospective there were only Polish colleagues from the team. Being Polish myself, I know about our quirks, and one of them is complaining. It's like hyperinflation, once it starts, there's no going back.

To set the right atmosphere, I decided to first talk about good things, to put people in a good mood. I asked them all the question:

What are some things that you think we do that make us deliver faster, better and generally contribute to us doing better work or what are you satisfied with recently?

Here everyone shared their perspective, observations, and so on.

### Baddies - gathering data
So, while they were still in good moods and the aura was positive, I dropped a bomb that sometimes opens the gates of hell on Polish retrospectives - what went wrong? Let's get specific. Enough sugarcoating. The onion way.

And here the complaining started. Or so it seemed to me - that it would start. Instead, it didn't.

I asked the question:

> What do you think we did wrong recently? What have you observed that makes us deliver less, slower? What makes your work less pleasant?

Instead of mindless babbling, the team did something nice. They presented constructive and smart observations, insights, and comments. Honestly, it was quite amazing. Sometimes I'm surprised by how smart the people I work with are.

### Happies - still gathering data
Since I like to change moods like a sine function changes its value, I changed the topic again.

This time I decided to facilitate talking about things we do that make us happy. This was a different question than the first one - good things we do - because here it wasn't about delivering, productivity, and generating value. It was about human bonds and how we behave towards each other, how we interact. I thought it would be nice if they told each other what they notice in others' behavior and what they appreciate.

I don't know about you, but I like to pat myself on the back sometimes - a sign that someone appreciates my efforts.

So:

> What do you appreciate that we do? Not in terms of productivity, coding, or technicality, but just as a human - what makes you want to be with us and spend our time together?

And this, oh my, this point was quite sweet honestly. So if we had sweet, it's time for bitter again.

### Stop, it hurts.
Now I decided to stir the waters a bit. I threw in the topic:

> Goals for improvement. What should we stop doing? What should we achieve to improve?

And here I decided that this retrospective shouldn't end with just empty talk. I mean sure, we improved some bonds, got to know each other a bit better and had a blast talking to each other (really!), but for me that's not enough.

So I threw in an idea.

Everyone, if they had such a wish, could voluntarily choose one or more tasks, their pain points, which they want to solve by the next retrospective.

Additionally, they also had to choose a ~~witcher~~, observer for their tasks. Owner might be a better word here. This person will be responsible for checking their progress and so on. Basically someone who will make sure the task gets done, besides that person. Someone who will nag them a bit, e.g., every other day ask the famous, at least in our company, question - What's the status here?

Why? While I trust my team colleagues to fully implement project-related things, these tasks were from the nice-to-have category and all, but we won't die if we don't do them. They weren't critical, just nice to do. Hence it would be good to have some responsibility and additional motivation to do them.

This also worked out - almost everyone decided on some tasks for themselves.

### Inception
After this came time for a small inception. A retrospective on the retrospective. Basically a short round of feedback about today's retrospective, my facilitation, generated value, and so on. Apparently they liked it, or so they said. Yeah.

That would be about it. After this the retrospective came to an end. I survived and actually found it sensible. But on the other hand quite demanding.

I'm young, I have a problem with my ego, you know. It was hard to be on the sidelines, for most of the time just observing, being a moderator, instead of an active participant. I had a few moments when I wanted to abandon my moderator role and engage as a team member, starting my endless talking, throwing in my two cents, but I restrained myself from this, managed to remain in my role.

This was a bit humbling and satisfying, honestly.

### Summary

Just so you know, later those tasks that we defined - were done. So it really didn't end with just empty talk. Apparently this idea with guardians for tasks also helped a bit - maybe it'll be useful to you too? I have no idea.

So well, Agile processes can also be cool and useful, that's first. Second, show empathy and check the other side of the fence, if you have some specific opinion or maybe strongly disagree with someone about something, try to understand. Maybe there's something valuable there, you just don't know about it. Finally, step out of your comfort zone. Thanks to this you'll develop. Coaching all the way. Who stole your dreams?

If you're also preparing for your first retro, maybe this article will be helpful to you. Additionally: protip. Take notes. I did. Later, after the retro, I turned them into a nice confluence page and tasks on Jira.

That would be it for today, I, Olaf, was your humble host, I hope you enjoyed it.
