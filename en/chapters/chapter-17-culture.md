# Culture

A few words about the culture of a programmer's work. About attitude and such. Although seemingly secondary things, some of them actually play a very important role in the software development process.

## A Bit About Managers/Leaders

A good manager/team leader is a person who can either lead a team to ruin or give them wings. Teams are the basic building block of companies. If a manager can destroy or give wings to a team, they can do the same to the entire company. This emphasizes how important it is to have someone normal in the role of a leader. How does one give wings or destroy? By operating on what the team consists of. On people. A person is the basic and most important unit in a company, whose willingness, and mainly generated unwillingness to work, is strongly dependent on the influences of leaders. I'll describe some of my thoughts on this, or rather observations about the path that some people go through and how it changes them in effect.

On my programming path, I've already met many managers in many different companies. Some were wonderful, had a positive impact on my life, others were complete idiots, and yet others are now almost like family to me. After some time, I started to notice certain patterns that occurred almost always, and which allowed me to isolate three boundary levels of being a manager.

### Level One: Excel Master

Excel Masters are often freshly minted managers, leaders who don't have much experience yet, but have plenty of ego, pride, and bravado. The world is open before them and ready to be conquered! They love their spreadsheets, write everything in them, optimize, sometimes practice micromanagement. These are people in the initial period of their managerial career, where a person can get somewhat intoxicated initially by their power.

This type of person often sees only one thing: money. Oh, I've met such people too often until a certain time. Money-grubbers. And they are precisely the most dangerous type of manager that can happen to a company, among the three I've mentioned.

Superficially speaking, Excel Masters look quite good. The numbers add up, plans, presentations, it's a fairy tale. But not entirely. In reality, everything falls apart. Why are they the most dangerous type? Because of the facade they impose - they're not the ones usually suspected of being the source of the problem, but after getting to know this species of animal, it's hard not to notice them in the future, and you often recognize them easily. How? Just find the most unhappy team in the company. A silent team that persists in quiet resignation, seemingly for some elusive reason. Don't look for a team that complains. They still have hope. Look for something else.
