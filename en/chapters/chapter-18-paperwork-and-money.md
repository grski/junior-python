# Paperwork and Money

A bit about employment contracts and compensation.

## Understanding Compensation and Contracts

A small note for the less familiar: net salary is the amount you take home after taxes, gross salary is the amount before taxes, and the total cost that your employer pays for you is usually a completely different amount. This works differently when billing as a contractor, but that's a different story. I'll explain that in a moment.

When starting your career, it's important to understand the different types of employment contracts available in your country. Each has its pros and cons, which you need to be aware of to make the most beneficial decision for yourself in a given situation.

Generally, there are three basic forms of employment:

1. Full-time employment contract
2. Contract work (fixed-term or project-based)
3. Independent contractor (B2B/freelance)

## Contract Work

Let's start with contract work - this is typically the most flexible form of employment for both employer and employee. A contract work agreement concerns performing specific tasks or services for a defined period.

The main advantages are:
- Flexibility in working hours
- Often higher hourly rates than full-time employment
- Clear project scope and deliverables

The main disadvantages are:
- Usually no benefits (health insurance, paid time off, etc.)
- Less job security
- Need to manage your own taxes and insurance

## Full-time Employment

The most traditional and secure option, but often the most expensive for employers. In short, it's obvious - you get all the standard benefits: health insurance, paid vacation, sick leave, and so on.

The main advantages are:
- Job security
- Benefits package
- Easier to get loans/mortgages
- Employer handles taxes and insurance

The main disadvantages are:
- Often lower take-home pay compared to contract work
- Less flexibility
- More bureaucratic processes

## Independent Contractor (B2B/Freelance)

Now a few words about being an independent contractor, what it is, who needs it, why, and an analysis of when it's worth switching to this form of work.

### What is Independent Contracting?

When browsing job offers for programmers, you can often come across salary ranges - it's rather standard in the industry to provide a range of possible compensation.

Often the form of cooperation is also provided. More and more often, instead of the well-known employment contract or contract work, something like "B2B" or "freelance" appears. What does this mean?

Independent contracting is a form of cooperation where you establish a relationship with a company not as an employee but as a business entity. This means that instead of becoming an official employee, you become a service provider for a given company, you need to register your own business and handle your own taxes and accounting.

### Advantages of Independent Contracting

Being an independent contractor carries a series of responsibilities, but at the same time gives certain possibilities that we don't have when working based on other forms of cooperation.

#### Tax Benefits

Probably the most significant advantage. As an independent contractor, you can often take advantage of various tax deductions and write-offs that aren't available to regular employees. This can include:
- Home office expenses
- Equipment and software
- Professional development
- Business travel
- Health insurance premiums

The exact benefits depend on your country's tax laws, but generally, independent contractors can reduce their taxable income significantly.

#### Flexibility and Control

The next major advantage is flexibility and control over your work:
- You can choose your projects
- Set your own rates
- Work with multiple clients
- Define your own working hours
- Choose your work location

### Disadvantages

There are quite a few of these. That's why it's worth considering whether independent contracting is the right choice for you - it's not suitable for everyone.

#### Administrative Responsibilities

Remember what I mentioned earlier? About taxes, accounting, and paperwork? With other forms of employment, all of this is handled by your employer. You're not interested in anything, except checking if the payment has arrived.

When you switch to independent contracting, all formal obligations fall on you. Your client only needs to remember to pay your invoice.

So what do you need to do as an independent contractor? There's quite a bit of this:
- Handle your own taxes
- Manage your own accounting
- Issue invoices
- Maintain business records
- Handle your own insurance

You can automate most of this by hiring an accountant, but this comes at a cost. Alternatively, you can do it yourself if you're comfortable with the administrative work.

#### No Employee Protections

As an independent contractor, you're not protected by employment laws. Everything depends on what you have in your contract. And there can be various things in it - from lack of notice period, to responsibility for any mistakes you make in work and the damage they cause.

You're also not protected against illness. Not working? No money. At least by default, because in the contract, if the client allows it, you can include an option for paid time off.

Similarly with vacation. There's no paid vacation here. Not providing services? No money.

#### Harder to Get Loans

Another disadvantage of independent contracting is that it's often harder to get loans, especially mortgages. Independent contractors are usually subject to various restrictions when they want to take out a mortgage.

The first restriction you'll encounter is the required period of running your business. Most banks require that you've been running your business continuously for at least 12-24 months.

Additionally, you'll need to provide more documentation:
- Business financial statements
- Tax returns
- Proof of consistent income
- Business registration documents

### Summary

To summarize, independent contracting is not a form of employment for everyone. It has its disadvantages like responsibility for various things falling on your head, but also advantages, because with greater responsibility comes greater control over your work and finances.

Is this a good form for you? I don't know. I'll almost certainly say one thing though, that if you have less than, let's say 6, and preferably 12, months of experience, and the amount that a potential client offers is not significantly higher than what you'd make as an employee, then better leave it and wait.

## Money

About a very important thing, which is money. Without shame and openly.

### How to Talk About Salary

I often see that we're ashamed to talk about money. Well, in my opinion this is a bit of a mistake. Human greed is a thing, but only if accompanied by certain principles and rules.

If this is your first job, which suggests the fact that you're reading this book, then well, honestly speaking, money isn't very important. In your first job you're actually only doing one thing... Learning.

At the beginning, for the first few days/weeks, even someone with 10 years of experience brings losses, because they need to be onboarded to the project, get to know the team and so on.

And this is natural. When hiring a Junior, every employer must be aware that they'll need to invest in them a bit first, so they can start being useful and bringing profits. So we're aware that this onboarding period will be longer.

So don't feel guilty that you're only learning at work and that's bad, nothing could be further from the truth.

This is a calculated move by every company, you as an employee who's training, growing in value and over time, when you reach a certain level, this investment in you will very quickly pay off through the work you do.

Let's be honest, your employer has to make money on something. They might make it on their own product, maybe on outsourcing, in any case, one way or another, they indirectly make money on you and your skills. Is this bad? No, a normal thing.

Nevertheless, please, never blame yourself for spending time at work learning, especially at the beginning, it's simply, as I mentioned, the employer's investment in you, which is actually quite profitable for them in the longer term.

To summarize, if you're just starting out, then the rate isn't important. Does this mean you should work for a proverbial bowl of rice? Absolutely not. You need to respect yourself and it's not worth going below a certain level. Simple.

When setting your rate, it's worth taking into account:
- The region where you live
- Other offers and ranges they offer
- Your skills and experience
- The company's size and financial situation

Do a little research. If you ask for too much, but you're a nice candidate, then the company will probably want to renegotiate rather than reject you right away, so don't be too afraid, but on the other hand don't throw amounts from outer space, because that also says something about you.

### Raise != More Take-Home Pay, About Time

Now a few words about how a raise doesn't always mean more money in your paycheck. Why?

Well, the matter is simple - we need to realize that we're basically selling our time to our employer and we need to calculate our paycheck relative to it. You can't always negotiate a raise in monetary form, because for example the company doesn't have additional funds, a specific rate is planned for someone with your experience, or something similar. You can then approach it from a different angle. How?

Probably the simplest example is reducing full-time - instead of working 5 days a week, ask for 4. Succeed? You've just reduced your full-time to 4/5, keeping the same salary, meaning effectively that's like a 20% raise per hour of your time. Pretty nice result in my opinion.

Another way to get a raise without a raise might be switching to remote work mode. I'll immediately note - this isn't for everyone and not in every company can such a work model be implemented.

However, if remote work suits you, there are no obstacles in the company and you manage to negotiate it - great. Why?

Because the time you spend on work isn't only the time you sit in the office. You need to calculate commuting time too. And we often spend a lot of time on this and sometimes it causes our actual rate to decrease by about 10% on average, assuming we have about 30 minutes to work.

With remote work there's no this problem - the time you spend commuting is exactly 0. Unless you go to some coworking, but that's then by choice, not by force. Your will.

Time is quite important, so let's talk about it.

The only thing we have in life is time. We need to manage it wisely, because we can't buy time, we can't add it to ourselves or make it run slower. Every day it slips away from us.

Programming is an industry you can get carried away with, so to speak. Relatively quickly you can reach really nice earnings here. This makes it possible to get a bit 'fixated' on this money and start working a lot. Too much. And they're not the most important thing after all.

Nevertheless it is. And we as programmers trade precisely our time usually - we sell the employer hours of our life in exchange for money. So know their value. Don't let yourself be possessed by the rush for money that will make you work 14 hours a day, because you'll earn more.

It's not worth it. Unless it gives you pleasure, you don't have a family, and your social life doesn't exist. Then you can.

The question is different though - how long can you endure mentally and physically?

## Equity Compensation

In addition to salary, many tech companies offer equity compensation as part of their total compensation package. This can be particularly valuable in startups and high-growth companies.

### Types of Equity Compensation

1. **Stock Options**
   - Give you the right to buy company stock at a fixed price (strike price)
   - Usually vest over 4 years with a 1-year cliff
   - Can be either Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) or Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs)
   - Tax implications vary by country and type

2. **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**
   - Actual shares granted over time
   - Typically vest over 4 years
   - Taxed as income when they vest
   - More common in established companies

3. **Virtual Stock Option Plans (VSOPs)**
   - Cash-settled options that don't involve actual company shares
   - Value is tied to company performance
   - Often used when actual equity isn't possible or practical
   - Can be structured to mimic traditional stock options

### Understanding Vesting

Vesting is the process by which you earn your equity over time. Common vesting schedules include:

- **4-year vesting with 1-year cliff**: You get nothing if you leave before 1 year, then 25% vests, followed by monthly/quarterly vesting
- **Monthly vesting**: Equal portions vest each month
- **Performance-based vesting**: Tied to company or individual milestones

### Evaluating Equity Offers

When considering an equity package:

1. **Understand the current valuation**
   - What is the company's current valuation?
   - How many shares are outstanding?
   - What percentage of the company do your options represent?

2. **Consider the potential**
   - What's the company's growth trajectory?
   - What's the exit strategy (IPO, acquisition)?
   - How long until you can exercise/sell?

3. **Calculate the potential value**
   - Current strike price vs. potential future value
   - Tax implications of exercising/selling
   - Opportunity cost vs. higher salary elsewhere

### Negotiating Equity

When negotiating equity:

1. **Ask about the equity pool**
   - How much equity is set aside for employees?
   - What's the typical grant for your level?

2. **Understand the terms**
   - Vesting schedule
   - Exercise window if you leave
   - Any special conditions or restrictions

3. **Consider the trade-offs**
   - More equity might mean lower salary
   - Earlier stage companies often offer more equity
   - Later stage companies might offer RSUs instead of options

### Tax Considerations

Equity compensation can have significant tax implications:

1. **Stock Options**
   - Exercise may trigger taxable events
   - Holding periods can affect tax rates
   - Different rules for ISOs vs. NSOs

2. **RSUs**
   - Taxed as income when they vest
   - May need to sell some shares to cover taxes
   - Capital gains on subsequent appreciation

3. **VSOPs**
   - Typically taxed as income when paid
   - May have different tax treatment than traditional options
   - Check local tax laws for specific rules

### My Experience with Equity

In my career, I've had the opportunity to work with different types of equity compensation:

1. **Early Stage Startups**
   - Larger equity grants
   - Higher risk but potentially higher reward
   - More influence on company direction

2. **Growth Stage Companies**
   - Mix of salary and equity
   - More stable but still significant upside
   - Clearer path to liquidity

3. **Established Companies**
   - RSUs as part of standard compensation
   - More predictable value
   - Regular vesting schedules

The key lesson I've learned is to evaluate equity as part of your total compensation package, considering both the potential upside and the associated risks. While equity can be extremely valuable, it's important to balance it with immediate needs and other forms of compensation.

## My Career Journey

I'll share my personal story to give you a real-world example of how a programming career can progress. This is my authentic journey, with all its ups and downs.

### Early Days

I started my programming career at 18 with no prior experience. My first position was as a Junior Python Backend Developer, working remotely from a small town for a company in a bigger city. This was quite unusual - I haven't met another person who started their career fully remote without any full-time experience. Somehow, I managed to make it work.

My first contract was for a two-month trial period in November 2017. I started at 18 PLN/hour, which translated to about 3,000 PLN monthly for full-time work. After the trial period, I received a 23% raise to 22 PLN/hour (about 3,700 PLN monthly). I actually tried to negotiate for 25 PLN/hour, but my boss declined, promising we'd revisit the topic later. Looking back, I can't help but laugh at my ambitious request for a 40% raise after just two months of learning.

### First Major Jump

After 8 months in my first role, I moved to a new company where my rate increased by about 60% to 37.50 PLN/hour (6,300 PLN monthly). This demonstrated a key lesson: changing companies can lead to significant salary increases. As they say, the easiest way to get a raise is to change jobs.

### Transition to B2B

After about 9 months of experience, I transitioned to B2B (business-to-business contracting) when my student status ended. My rates remained similar but with better tax optimization, allowing me to earn between 8,000-10,000 PLN monthly after taxes. I also started working for multiple clients, including some international ones where my rate jumped to 60 PLN/hour.

### Career Acceleration

At 1.5 years of experience, I received an offer of 86 PLN/hour for fully remote work. This was a significant milestone - I had officially joined what some might call the "high-earner programmer" club. I was working remotely, with a great team, and felt financially appreciated.

### Entrepreneurial Phase

At 21, with 3 years of experience, I started my own company while also working full-time. This period was intense - I had 7-8 full-time employees and was working multiple jobs simultaneously. My earnings fluctuated wildly, from 100 PLN/hour to a record 600 PLN/hour. Monthly earnings ranged from 15,000 to 60,000-70,000 PLN.

However, this period also taught me important lessons about work-life balance. I got carried away by the money, pressure, and a bit of a "God complex." Working too much eventually took its toll, and in Q4 2021, I took a year-long break to recover and reflect.

### Return and New Opportunities

When I was exactly 23 with 5 years of experience (or 8 counting overtime), I signed a significant contract that included:
- Base salary equivalent to 36,000 PLN gross on employment contract
- Stock options worth 130,000 EUR, vesting over 5 years
- 26 days of paid vacation
- 3,000 EUR annual development budget
- 20,000 PLN signing bonus
- Fully remote work

This seemed like a dream come true, but it ended abruptly when I was fired after publishing an article about human-centered management that conflicted with the company's actual practices. However, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise - I immediately found a better opportunity with another company I had previously turned down.

### Current Situation

Today, I'm working as a Lead Python Developer, earning 36,500 PLN net on B2B (about 210 PLN/hour), fully remote. I'm much happier with how things turned out, as the new company better aligns with my values and approach to work.

### Key Lessons from My Journey

1. **Early Career is About Learning**: Don't focus too much on money at the start. Your first job is primarily about gaining experience and skills.

2. **Changing Companies Can Accelerate Growth**: Sometimes the best way to increase your earnings is to move to a new opportunity.

3. **Work-Life Balance is Crucial**: No amount of money is worth burning out. I learned this the hard way during my entrepreneurial phase.

4. **Values Matter**: It's important to work for companies that align with your values. The highest-paying job isn't always the best one.

5. **Remote Work is Powerful**: Starting my career remotely was challenging but ultimately gave me valuable experience in self-management and communication.

6. **Continuous Learning is Key**: Each step of my journey required learning new skills, whether technical or business-related.

7. **Network and Reputation Matter**: Many of my best opportunities came through connections and maintaining a good professional reputation.

This journey shows that with dedication, continuous learning, and a bit of luck, it's possible to progress quickly in the tech industry. However, it's crucial to maintain balance and stay true to your values along the way.
