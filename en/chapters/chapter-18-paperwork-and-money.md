# Paperwork and Money

A bit about paperwork.

## Net, Gross, Contracts, Costs

A small note for the less familiar: net is the amount you take home, gross is the amount before some taxes, and the total cost that your employer pays for you is yet another amount entirely in most cases. It's a bit different when settling on a contractor basis, but that's another matter. I'll describe it in a moment.

### Understanding Employment Types

In general, we have several basic forms of employment on the market between a company and an individual. Different countries have various contract types, but the principles are generally similar:

1. **Employee contracts** (full employment) - Most regulated, with benefits like paid leave, health insurance, pension contributions, and job protection. The employer handles all tax withholdings and contributions.

2. **Freelance/Contractor agreements** - You provide services as an independent contractor. Less protection, but potentially more flexibility and different tax treatment.

3. **Self-employment/B2B** - You run your own business and invoice the company for your services.

The key thing to understand is the difference between what you see on paper and what actually lands in your bank account. Let me give you an example.

If an employer pays you $5,000 "net" (take-home) per month, the gross amount (before taxes and contributions) might be around $6,500-7,000, and the total cost to the employer (including their portion of social contributions) could be $7,500-8,500 or more, depending on your jurisdiction.

Yes, 30-40% or more of what your employer spends on you can go to various taxes, insurance, and other mandatory contributions. That's just the reality of employment in most countries.

This is why understanding the full picture matters when negotiating compensation.

### Contract Considerations

Should everyone avoid employee contracts and go freelance? No, each form of employment has its pros and cons that you need to be aware of to make the best decision for your situation.

**Employee contracts** offer:
- Job security and notice periods
- Paid vacation and sick leave
- Health insurance and pension contributions
- Legal protections under labor law
- Easier access to mortgages and loans

**Freelance/Contractor work** offers:
- Often higher gross rates
- More flexibility
- Potentially better tax optimization
- Independence

**Full self-employment (B2B)** offers:
- Maximum potential earnings
- Full control over your taxes and business
- Business expense deductions
- Complete flexibility

But with each step toward independence, you take on more responsibility and risk.

### B2B - Self-Employment

Now a few words about the mysterious B2B, what it is, what's it for, and why, plus an analysis of when it's worth switching to this form of cooperation. I'm dedicating a whole chapter to this topic because it's a river of a subject.

#### What is B2B

Browsing job listings for programmers, you can often come across salary ranges - it's pretty much standard in the industry to give the range of possible salary. At the same time, the form of cooperation is often given. More and more often, you can observe that instead of the well-known employee contract, something like B2B appears. What does that mean?

B2B is short for Business to Business - it's a form of cooperation where you enter into a relationship with a company not as an employee but as another business. This simply means that instead of becoming an official employee, you become a service provider for the given company, you have to set up your own business and settle through invoices. But again - what does this specifically mean and what does it entail?

Let me start with why employers like B2B. Well, the matter is simple - firstly, a person 'employed' on B2B is simpler to settle - as an employer, you don't have an employee to settle and maintain, but just a cost - an invoice to pay. That's where the employer's responsibility ends in the case of B2B.

B2B also allows you to reduce employment costs. As I already calculated, with employee contracts, the amounts that are given to the government every month are terrifying. You spend over $8,000, the employee gets $5,000 of that. And that's just taxes; on top of that, you still have to add the costs of HR handling.

Making sure the appropriate documents are submitted, transfers sent, and contributions deducted - with employee contracts, our employer takes care of that. All these activities take time and cost money, generating additional expenses.

Additionally, with B2B, labor laws don't apply. That's a huge number of restrictions and regulations that protect the employee, which the employer must comply with. In a B2B relationship? Nothing like that exists.

B2B therefore removes a lot of obligations from the employer's shoulders and shifts them to yours. You have to register your business, then regularly pay your taxes, issue invoices, keep documentation, and so on.

You might ask then - why would anyone agree to something like that? Well, with greater responsibility come certain benefits.

Before I list them, I'll note that B2B is not a form of cooperation suitable for everyone. I'll try to describe the pros and cons of this cooperation fairly objectively, although it might be difficult because I'm actually a fan and supporter.

#### B2B Advantages

Being on B2B, or so-called self-employment, brings a number of responsibilities, but at the same time gives certain possibilities that we don't have when working based on other forms of cooperation. What are these advantages? I'll list two, in my opinion, the most important ones.

##### Lower Taxes

Probably my favorite advantage. We've already done the calculations on how much percentage of our salary goes to government bodies. As a reminder: earning $5,000 net, or take-home, with an employee contract, the employer has to pay around $8,500 for us. Quite a lot, right? That $3,500 is eaten up by various types of taxes. On top of that, pay for the HR staff. A disaster.

And here comes B2B, all in white, which allows us to minimize these taxes a bit. How much? Let's calculate.

The specific savings depend heavily on your jurisdiction's tax laws, but generally, self-employed individuals can:

1. **Deduct business expenses** - Equipment, software, training, home office costs, etc.
2. **Choose optimal tax structures** - Many jurisdictions offer different taxation options for self-employed individuals
3. **Time income recognition** - More flexibility in when you recognize income
4. **Potentially lower overall tax burden** - Especially at higher income levels

As an example, in many jurisdictions, if you're earning $100,000+ annually, the difference between employment and self-employment taxation can be $10,000-20,000 or more per year.

However - and this is important - B2B typically only makes financial sense above a certain income threshold. If you're just starting out and earning relatively modest amounts, the administrative burden and loss of benefits might not be worth it.

##### Business Expense Deductions

The next point in favor of switching to B2B are the so-called 'business expenses.' I already mentioned them earlier. What exactly are they?

As an entrepreneur, to run your business, you often need various things. In our case, as programmers, these will be various digital equipment, training materials in the form of books, e-books, subscriptions to learning platforms, a car that's necessary for getting to the client (company). And so on.

All these costs that we can demonstrate were needed to generate income, we can consider as costs of running our business. Consequently, we can 'deduct them from taxes.' What does that mean?

In short, things bought for the business can reduce your taxable income. The specific mechanics depend on your jurisdiction - it might be VAT recovery, income tax deductions, or both. This can effectively reduce the real cost of business purchases by 20-40% depending on your tax situation.

What can be costs? You could write a separate book about it, because human creativity knows no bounds. Really.

These points are the two most important advantages of B2B. So in short, the most important advantage of B2B is... money. Besides that - freedom and independence. That's all. And that's why we take the risk. What and how? I'll explain now.

#### Disadvantages

And there are quite a few. That's why it's worth considering whether B2B is the choice for us - it's not suitable for everyone.

##### Responsibility on Your Head

Remember what I mentioned earlier? About contributions, taxes, offices? With other forms of cooperation, all of this is on your employer's head. You don't care about anything at all, except checking if the transfer is already there.

The moment you switch to B2B, all formal obligations fall on you. Your employer only needs to remember to pay the invoice you issue them.

So what do you have to do as an entrepreneur? There's quite a bit. First thing is paying your taxes - income tax, social contributions if applicable, potentially sales tax/VAT. You'll need to maintain proper records and file returns regularly.

Usually there's also bookkeeping to be done.

Every month you also need to issue an invoice for your services and send it to your client.

Sounds like there's a lot, right? Well, firstly, practically everything on this list, except issuing the invoice, you can automate for about $100-200 monthly by investing in an accountant who will do it for you.

Alternatively, you can do it yourself. I personally chose this option. Why?

It only sounds complicated, but actually it all comes down to making a transfer or clicking 'submit return' in accounting software - the rest is done by programs.

All my accounting takes maybe 30 minutes monthly, so I'd hate to pay someone for something so simple.

##### Lack of Protection

On B2B, all moves are allowed, or rather I should say, everything depends on what's in your contract. And it can contain various things - starting from no notice period, ending with liability for any mistakes you make at work and damages they cause.

And being a person who runs a sole proprietorship, you're liable for your mistakes with all your assets.

You're also not protected against illness. You don't work? No money. At least by default, because in the contract, if the employer allows it, you can include a paid 'sick leave' option, even on B2B.

Same with vacation. Here there's no paid leave by default. You don't provide service? No money.

Again - at least by default. Usually this issue is solved by adding to the monthly rate a specific amount that's a proportional equivalent of how much you lose if you take standard vacation for 20 or 25+ days a year. What does this look like?

Let's say you're a young person, like me, so you're entitled to 20 days of vacation per year if you worked on an employee contract.

Let's assume further that your hourly rate is $50 net, meaning 8*$50 = $400 daily.

Let's calculate further, $400 daily, 20 vacation days, 20 days * $400/day = $8,000. Therefore, to the hourly rate you should add: $8,000 / (12 months * 168 hours/month) = $3.97/h, rounding, $4/h.

To this we add the tax we have to pay on this $4, which is, rounding, 20%, meaning: $4/h + $4/h * 20% = $4/h + $0.8/h = $4.8/h, basically $5/h.

So if I ultimately want to earn $50 net, then without paid vacations included in the contract, I should demand at least $55/h.

I, however, for example, prefer not to complicate things this way, and arrange normal paid vacation with the employer, or, as it's officially written in the contract, paid days of break in service provision. Some employers give 20, others 25, still others 30. It all depends on what's in the contract - standard.

In any case. It clearly shows one thing - you reap what you sow. On B2B this saying is even more true.

On the other hand, it's not like everyone's just waiting for you to make some mistake or error to sue you, charge you with costs. No.

##### Harder to Get a Loan

Another disadvantage of B2B is that it's a bit harder to get a loan, especially a mortgage. Entrepreneurs are usually burdened with various restrictions if they want to take out a mortgage.

The first restriction we'll encounter is the required period of business operation. Practically every bank requires that we run our business uninterruptedly for at least 12 months, and in many of them, this period is 24 months.

So this is something important - if you want to take out a mortgage in the next few months, definitely don't switch to B2B.

Actually, any credit at all. Seriously. Banks often automatically reject applications from self-employed individuals who haven't been in business long enough, regardless of income level.

Sometimes a larger down payment is also required - this is supposed to be a guarantee for the bank that shows you're actually able to deliver money and pay off your loan, because an entrepreneur is after all a higher risk.

Additionally, a mortgage on B2B means more paperwork. Banks usually want proof that you're current on all tax obligations, plus your financial records going back a year or more, tax returns, etc.

However, it's not that bad, at least in our industry, because some banks, seeing that for programmers B2B is essentially another form of employment and not a real business venture, sometimes meet us halfway and treat us preferentially. This is, however, rather an exception to the rule and such preferential treatment rarely happens.

Let's not demonize the whole process on the other hand, because it's also mainly formalities, especially if you're taking out a loan at the same bank where you have your business account.

#### Summary

In summary, B2B is not a form of employment for everyone. It has its disadvantages such as the responsibility for various things falling on your head, but also advantages, because with greater responsibility comes greater power. In this aspect, specifically over the money your employer spends on you.

Is it a good form for you? I don't know. But I'll almost certainly say one thing: if you have less than, say, 6, and preferably 12, months of experience, and the amount the potential employer offers is less than a reasonable rate for a senior developer in your market, then give it a rest and wait.

At the beginning, if you're just starting out, there's no discussion. Take the stable employment option and focus on learning.

If you're earning significantly more and your tax burden is substantial, consider self-employment, especially if you qualify for any startup tax benefits in your jurisdiction.

When you're earning even more, think about more sophisticated corporate structures. Although that's probably not the target audience here - at that point, it's worth investing in a tax advisor.

## Money

About a very important thing, which is money. Without shame and openly. Let's start with something I mentioned in another chapter.

### How to Talk About Salary

I often see that we're ashamed to talk about money. Well, in my opinion, that's a bit of a mistake. Human greed is a thing, but only if accompanied by certain principles and rules.

If this is your first job, which is suggested by the fact that you're reading this book, then honestly, money isn't that important. In your first job, all you really do is... Learn.

At the beginning, for the first few days/weeks, even someone with 10 years of experience generates losses because they have to be onboarded to the project, get to know the team, and so on.

And that's natural. When hiring a Junior, every employer must be aware that they'll have to invest in them a bit first before they start being useful and bringing profits. So we're aware that this onboarding period will be longer.

So don't feel bad that you're just learning at work and that's bad - nothing could be further from the truth.

This is a deliberate move by every company. You as an employee who's upskilling increase in value and with time, when you reach a certain level, this investment in you will very quickly pay off through the work you do.

Let's be honest, your employer has to earn something and that's it. They earn maybe on their own product, maybe on outsourcing, anyway, no matter how you look at it, they indirectly earn on you and your skills. Is that bad? No, a normal thing.

Nevertheless, please never blame yourself for spending time at work learning, especially at the beginning - it's simply, as I already mentioned, the employer's investment in you, which is, to be honest, quite profitable for them in the longer term.

We don't live in a world where people are selfless, but is that bad? In this case, I think a saying applies - 'the wolf is fed and the sheep is whole.' You have to be grateful that someone gave you a chance, but also aware that this is not pure altruism, but rather a calculation aimed at profit, and that's completely normal, nothing wrong.

Moreover, I'll say one more thing: if you ever encounter at work something like being told to learn only after hours, or learning things needed to do a new project or something similar isn't included in work hours, then honestly, that's not a great sign.

This might suggest that you've ended up at some kind of sweatshop where the boss is a typical penny-pincher. It's worth thinking about changing jobs then. Although as they say, it's easiest to look for a job when you already have one.

In summary, if you're just starting out, the rate isn't important. But does that mean you should work for peanuts? Absolutely not. You have to respect yourself and not go below a certain level. Simple. What is that level?

Hard to judge, a lot depends on what you can do, but assuming you're reading this book, it seems to me that you're a fairly ambitious person and you'll know something after some time.

When setting your rate, it's worth taking into account the region where you live, other job listings and the salary ranges they offer. Do a little research. If you ask for too much but you're a nice candidate, the company will rather want to renegotiate than immediately reject you, so don't be too afraid, but on the other hand don't throw out cosmic amounts, because that also says something about you.

Again, common sense saves you, although drill it into your head hard: with your first job, money isn't that important. But definitely don't be like some desperate people who declare they'll even work for free for six months just to get their claws into some IT job. Yes, such specimens exist.

### A Raise != More on Your Paycheck - About Time

Now a few words about the fact that a raise doesn't always mean more money on your paycheck. Why?

Well, the matter is simple - we have to realize that we're essentially selling our time to our employer and we need to calculate our salary relative to it. You won't always manage to negotiate a monetary raise, because for example the company doesn't have additional funds, for someone of your experience a specific rate is precisely planned, or something similar. You can then strike from a different angle. What?

Probably the simplest example is reducing your workload - instead of working 5 days a week, ask for 4. Did it work? You just reduced your workload to 4/5, keeping the same salary, meaning effectively it's sort of a 20% raise per hour of your time. A nice result if you ask me.

Another way to get a raise without a raise might be switching to remote work. Right away I'll note - this isn't for everyone and not every company can implement such a work model, which I'll write about in another chapter.

However, if remote work suits you, there are no obstacles in the company, and you manage to negotiate it - great. Why?

Because the time you devote to work isn't just the time you sit in the office. You also have to factor in commutes. And on these, we often spend a lot of time and sometimes they cause our actual hourly rate to drop by about 10% on average, assuming we have about 30 minutes to work.

In the case of remote work, there's no such problem - the time you spend commuting is a round 0. Unless you go to some coworking space, but that's by choice, not necessity. Your will.

Time is quite important, so let's talk about it.

The only thing we have in life is time. We have to manage it wisely, because we can't buy time, we can't add it or make it run slower. It escapes us every day.

Programming is an industry you can get drunk on, so to speak. Relatively quickly you're able to reach really nice earnings here, especially compared to average wages in many regions. I know this from my own experience. Back in 2017, my main income was physical work on construction sites. At first for barely minimum wage, then a bit more, to finally end up with a slightly higher hourly rate. Suddenly boom, a year later I'm earning several times that.

This causes you to get a bit 'fixated' on this money and start working a lot. Too much. And it's not the most important thing after all. I know, I know. Cliche. What do you know about life, kid?

That's nevertheless how it is. And we as programmers trade precisely our time usually - we sell the employer hours of our life in exchange for money. So know their value. Don't let the rush for cash take over, which will make you work 14 hours a day because you'll earn more.

Not worth it. Unless it gives you pleasure, you don't have a family, and your social life doesn't exist. Then you can.

The question is different, though - how long can you hold out mentally and physically?

## My Case

I'll tell you a little bit about what my next steps on the programmer's path looked like in terms of salary.

### My First Earnings, First Raise

What did it look like in my case? I'm not ashamed to talk about money, so let me give you figures from my beginnings in programming.

I worked remotely, living in a small town, for a company in a bigger city. This is a very rarely encountered situation - remote work when I had no employment experience. I haven't met another person who started this way, but I somehow managed. Anyway.

I started my first job with a rate of about $12 per hour, which converted to 168 working hours per month, meaning a full-time job, gave around $2,000 take-home. It varied though, because I didn't do that many hours per month at the beginning. I described the list of what I knew going to my first job later.

I signed my first contract for a two-month trial period. This was in November 2017. After it ended, my contract was extended with a new rate of about $15 per hour net, basically around $2,500 per month. A 23% raise after two months. And that was the rate my boss proposed to me. I tried to negotiate more then, I wanted to push for $17 net.

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to negotiate that much, but it didn't cause anyone to look at me sideways or fire me. Absolutely not. I simply met with a refusal and a promise that we'd return to the topic.

The second thing was that I didn't push hard for that raise, so that's another matter, because at that time I was basically just learning, and my effectiveness in the project was low.

Yet another thing is that I got a fairly large percentage raise, 23%, while here I proposed 40%, so looking at it in retrospect, a little 'LOL' comes to my lips.

### Next Contract and Self-Employment

The next raise came in August - after 8 months from starting work, when I signed a contract with a new company - here my rate grew to about $25/h net, meaning $4,200 at 168 hours per month. Here the raise was really big, almost 60%. As they say - the simplest way to get a raise is to change jobs. Hard to disagree.

After a month, I decided to switch to a different form of employment - self-employment/contractor.

Here the conditions changed, but the rate remained +/- the same, except that depending on how I did my taxes, it could increase a bit to ~$27 per hour, clean, take-home. I mention take-home because the net amount as a contractor isn't the amount you keep :) As a contractor, the take-home amount should be called net of the net amount, or something.

Then, the contract with company #3, which I signed after 3 months at the previous company, was again for about the same rate more or less, more rather than less, however the topics I worked on were much more developmental and demanding. Money isn't everything.

Besides, I didn't part ways with the second company but switched to remote work mode, doing extra work for them after hours. My monthly earnings after going self-employed (meaning ~9 months of experience) didn't fall below $7,000 gross, of which take-home, with creative accounting, I kept about $5,500.

Sometimes I'd hit $8,000 gross, meaning roughly $6,500 clean. The amount depended on the month and how many hours I worked.

However, it never came to situations where I worked, I don't know, 300 hours.

### Further Developments

That's how I spent the next 3 months - working on two fronts. Then I gave up the second job, stayed at one job, in-office. Actually, I didn't give it up - the EU project funds ran out for the CEO. I mean, funds for developers. He wrapped up what was his and disappeared lol.

I stayed there for another 3 months. In the meantime, I managed to find a source of contracts for foreign clients. Here my rate jumped to $40/h net. There wasn't a lot of it, but some came in.

Three months passed from that moment, my contract with the current company was coming to an end - we initially signed it for 6 months, as a kind of trial period, because overall the company really dealt with ambitious things and we had to see if I could handle it. Well, they were rather satisfied with me. I received an offer to extend the contract with a new rate.

The new rate I was offered was $6,500 net per month, meaning exactly $40/h basically, at an average of 168 h per month, with an agreement that after 3-4 months we'd raise it to $8,000 net plus an indefinite contract.

At the same time, it just so happened that I had a completely different offer from another place. There they immediately offered me $50/h, meaning about $8,000 net for a month of work.

Vacation days the same, everything else basically similar.

And at that moment, I felt a bit like I had caught God by the legs. Don't get me wrong, earlier I also earned $7,000 or $8,000 a month without any problem, however, it was paid for by working a lot of overtime. Here, on the other hand, both rates concerned the basic position. I was really satisfied and happy.

I didn't take either of these offers, and I left the current company.

What? Yes.

### Leaving

I did it with a heavy heart really. I kind of bonded with the people in the company, the team. Actually, for the first time in my life, I got so attached to a company. In previous ones, I didn't have that at all.

Damn, it was nice. Great office right in the center, 15 minutes from me by public transport, initiatives, team building, top-shelf equipment from the start, social packages, development, a company that didn't spare anything for employees and took care of what was theirs. Sure, sometimes it was hard because the topics to handle in the team weren't the easiest, but overall I always went to the office very willingly. Wonderful community.

And yet I left. Why?

### New Opportunity

An opportunity appeared before me. An opportunity to participate in co-creating a certain venture. A very cool venture that I believe in strongly. With really smart and interesting people. So I didn't think long.

And so I started doing what I'm doing now.

In summary: I received an offer of $58 net/h, completely remote work. So, if it's a month with 22 working days, I officially joined the high earners club. Overall, I'm very happy about this and feel very financially appreciated.

Here again, my luck in life shows and the fact that I meet people who help me.

I'll tell you one thing, the IT world is very, very small. By building good relationships, leaving a good reputation behind, and being overall just a good person, you can gain a lot. This opportunity came to me precisely through something like that. I'll tell you honestly, I'm very happy.

Especially since it's remote work. As if that wasn't enough, a really capable team. Honestly, I kind of feel like I don't deserve this much money considering my skills - I honestly don't know anything special. I have no idea how this happened.

### Nothing Good Lasts Forever

The next period was a time when my professional life was turbulent. I had 3 years of experience then and left the company I just described after about 1.5 years. Here a wild ride and variations began, which generally ended with me somehow landing with my own company and 7-8 employees on payroll. WHAT THE. On top of that, I was simultaneously doing a job on the side. My earnings here could be crazy from $70 per hour to, record, $400/h. Yes. $400/h. Quite a mix. During this period, my monthly earnings ranged from $10k to around $40-50k monthly. The average varied, but toward the end, at least $35k to pocket I was grabbing, though it's worth noting I was working a bit too much. I got carried away by fantasy, pressure, God complex, and getting drunk on money. At some point, something broke. I stepped off the stage and disappeared for quite a while. Thus began my year-long gap in my resume, my fall, from which I'm just returning - a year when I hit record personal highs as well as lows.

What was happening to me then? It's a long story.

### Return to Reality

When I was exactly 23 and had 5 years of experience under my belt, an interesting situation occurred. Counting overtime, that's about 8 years worth, by the way. A few days before my birthday, I signed a contract. More or less it comes down to an equivalent of: $25k gross on employment plus $130k in stock options, vesting over 5 years. In practice, this means that if I work at the company for at least a year, I'll get a package of options currently valued at $26k. Then for the next 4 years, every month more options worth $2.1k. However, it's worth noting that these options/shares were relatively worth quite little. I mean, the valuation was $130k at the time, but relatively little compared to the company's potential.

The company is in a phase of dynamic growth and before those 5 years pass, I expect the valuation of these shares to grow 5-10x, plus I also expect to negotiate more shares during these years. So far, at the current market valuation, accounting for all bonuses etc., it comes out to ~$30k gross monthly equivalent. Plus $3k per year for development. And oh, I also got a signing bonus. $15k cash came in. Remote work, of course. Plus 26 days of paid vacation.

I have more luck in life than sense. I came back after almost a year-long break and the blind chicken found a grain.

So it would seem. A fairy tale, right? It was, until the first week of work when someone read my article about how you have to manage people humanely, not based on Excel, which with the approval and review of the content creation team, we posted on the blog. Then I was fired effective immediately. Ordnung muss sein. I collided with the hypocrisy of an organization where they wiped their mouths with putting people first, justice, and human approach, but where reality was the opposite, where a manager in the first week threw out words "Olaf, this is your team, I'm not attached to them and I don't care, if you don't like something about them, we can fire them and hire someone else." Not very human approach. It completely didn't match my approach, which assumes that a person is something more than a cog in a machine.

That same day, however, I already made a deal with another company that I had originally rejected. I couldn't be happier with how things turned out.
