# Setting Up the Environment

Let's finally move on to something concrete - let's get our hands a bit dirty, because so far I've just been talking and talking. We'll start by setting up the environment/installing Python and something for text editing. Just a moment, what exactly? There are two options - a simple text editor or an IDE. What will we choose?

## What to Write Code in at the Beginning?
What to write code in at the beginning? IDE/Text editor? PyCharm? Sublime? VS Code?

When I think about my first days of learning programming, one of the many things that constantly confused me and caused quite a bit of trouble in deciding was the choice of environment in which I would write my first programs.

There's no need to be surprised here - nowadays, practically every language has at least several free IDEs, plus there are paid ones, we have text editors, and so on. It's easy to get lost. At least that's what I did, and instead of learning programming, I spent several days sitting and thinking about choosing the environment.

### IDE? Text Editor?

So how is it in the end? IDE or text editor? And what is an IDE anyway? Find out for yourself - as an IT specialist, your basic task is to process information. So look up the meaning of this acronym on the Internet, look up the differences between an IDE and a text editor.

I won't serve this to you on a silver platter because the ability to search for information is a key trait that makes up a good IT specialist/programmer, which needs to be practiced from the beginning, and this is what I'll try to develop in you throughout the pages of this book.
