# Remote Work

Let's talk a bit about remote work and how to do it humanely.

Many people don't realize that remote work requires certain issues to be solved well. Otherwise, it can be unpleasant in the long term. Remote work is not just working from home. Well-implemented, it requires changes not only in the location of work performed.

## Ergonomics

When working remotely, we sometimes forget about ergonomics or work hygiene. Being young, it's easy to fall into the myth of indestructibility. After all, you don't feel the consequences of certain actions immediately. Only after years do certain things come out. I'm saying this, a 23-year-old person. I've been spending hours at the computer for many years. In the industry for 5. Despite this, I've already learned what professional burnout or health problems caused by work mean. I don't want you to share my fate. So take care of the ergonomics of the place where you work. This will allow you not only to be healthier but also more effective in your work in the longer perspective.

What this specifically means, I'll discuss using my example.

### My Ergonomic Setup

Let's analyze how my situation looks and what equipment I use.

1. External monitor + laptop.
   Simple matter. An additional external monitor allows me to facilitate work through a larger surface for displaying things. It's nice if they're at least 27", high resolution. For some, FullHD is enough, for others, 2K is too little. I personally lean towards 2k/4k. 4k might be a bit too much, hence 2k seems like a compromise to me. A good monitor won't strain your eyes. In my case, a 27" Dell refurbished monitor that I bought for 800 PLN works well. 2k resolution. This additional monitor really improved and streamlined my work.
