# Remote Work

Let's talk a bit about remote work and how to do it properly.

Many people don't realize that remote work requires certain aspects to be handled well. Otherwise, it can become unpleasant in the long term. Remote work isn't just about working from home. When properly implemented, it requires changes not only in the work location but also in how we approach work.

## Ergonomics

When working remotely, we sometimes forget about ergonomics and work hygiene. Being young, it's easy to fall into the myth of indestructibility. After all, the consequences of certain actions aren't immediately felt. It's only after years that certain things come to light. I'm saying this as a 23-year-old who has spent hours at the computer for many years and has been in the industry for 5 years. Despite this, I've already experienced what professional burnout and work-related health problems mean. I don't want you to share my fate. So take care of the ergonomics of your workspace. This will not only help you stay healthier but also make you more effective in your work in the long run.

I'll explain what this means specifically using my own example.

### My Ergonomic Setup

Let's analyze my situation and the equipment I use.

1. External monitor + laptop.
   Simple matter. An additional external monitor allows me to work more efficiently by providing more screen space. It's nice if it's at least 27", high resolution. For some, FullHD is enough, for others 2K is too little. Personally, I lean towards 2K/4K. 4K might be a bit too much, so 2K seems like a good compromise. A good monitor won't strain your eyes. I use a 27" Dell refurbished monitor that I bought for 800 PLN. 2K resolution. This additional monitor really improved and streamlined my work.
2. Microphone
   When working remotely, it's nice to have a good microphone. For 200-300 PLN you can get really good equipment that ensures you're heard clearly, with noise reduction, etc. I recommend Thronmaxxy. The price-to-quality ratio is amazing. It's always nice when there are no problems understanding your coworker. The devil is in the details.
3. Webcam
   Usually, the built-in one is enough, or for more demanding users, an external webcam, or for the most demanding geeks, a digital camera connected to the laptop. It's nice to have occasional eye contact with coworkers. However, don't overuse it - a webcam isn't always necessary.
4. Standing desk.
   I'm terribly hyperactive. A standing desk helps me manage this. Additionally, the fact that I stand up from time to time is good for my health, back, and overall physical condition. Sitting isn't very healthy. Muscle contractions, spine problems. You can really mess yourself up.
5. Good chair
   If we're sitting a lot, it's best to do it on something comfortable. Some like exercise balls, others ergonomic chairs, others stools. There are many preferences. I personally recommend a good chair like Ergohuman or something similar but cheaper. It's a one-time expense that pays off.

The above items are, in my opinion, the basics of ergonomic remote work that are useful if we want to maintain our health for years. Of course, you can work without these. You don't need to buy a thousand-zloty chair or a three-hundred-zloty microphone just for learning. No. However, if you're already a professional, don't be afraid to invest in your equipment. These are your work tools just like any others. You'll make life easier for yourself and others.

I know this might seem funny, but I subconsciously take people with a nice setup a bit more seriously. It's not an indicator of anything, but that's just how I am. It subconsciously signals certain things to me.

At the end of the day, of course, what matters is whether you deliver and aren't a jerk, but still.

Here are some tips for people working remotely:

1. Create an appropriate workspace: Make sure your workspace is comfortable and ergonomic. Avoid working from bed or the couch, as this can lead to spine problems and other ailments.
2. Set time boundaries: It's important to set time boundaries for your work to properly separate work and private life.
3. Maintain good communication: Remote work requires good communication with other team members and superiors. Make sure you have access to appropriate communication tools like internet messengers or video conferences.
4. Take care of your health: Remote work can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which isn't healthy. Make sure you maintain proper posture at the computer and get up from time to time to stretch and do some exercises.
5. Maintain discipline: Remote work can be difficult if you don't have proper discipline. Set your daily schedule and stick to it as if you were working in an office.
6. Keep a routine: Remote work can be distracting, so it's important to maintain a routine, such as setting fixed working hours and taking regular breaks.
