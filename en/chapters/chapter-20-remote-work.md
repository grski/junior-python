# Remote Work

Let's talk a bit about remote work and how to do it properly.

Many people don't realize that remote work requires certain things to be done right. Otherwise, it can be unpleasant in the long term. Remote work is not just working from home. Properly implemented, it requires changes not only in the location where work is performed.

## Ergonomics

When working remotely, we sometimes forget about ergonomics and work hygiene. When you're young, it's easy to fall into the myth of invincibility. After all, you don't immediately feel the consequences of certain actions. Only after years do certain things come out. I'm saying this as a 23-year-old person. I've been spending hours at the computer for many years. In the industry for 5. Despite that, I've already learned what burnout or health problems caused by work mean. I don't want you to share my fate. So take care of the ergonomics of the place you work from. This will allow you not only to be healthier but also more effective in your work in the longer perspective.

I'll discuss what this specifically means using my own example.

### My Ergonomic Setup

Let's analyze what my situation looks like and what equipment I use.

1. External monitor + laptop.
   Simple thing. An additional external monitor allows me to facilitate work through a larger surface area for displaying things. It's nice if they're at least 27", high resolution. For some Full HD is enough, for others 2K is too little. I personally lean towards 2K/4K. 4K might be a bit too much, hence 2K seems like a compromise. A proper monitor won't strain your eyes. For me, a 27" refurbished Dell that I bought for cheap works well. 2K resolution. This additional monitor really improved and streamlined my work.

2. Microphone
   When working remotely, it's nice to have a good microphone. For $50-100 you can have really decent equipment and you're guaranteed to be heard well, noise reduction, etc. I recommend Thronmax. The price-to-quality ratio is incredible. It's always nice when there are no problems understanding a coworker. The devil is in the details.

3. Webcam
   Usually the built-in one is enough, or for more demanding users an external webcam, or for the most demanding geeks a digital camera connected to a laptop. It's nice to have eye contact with coworkers from time to time. However, you shouldn't overuse this, a webcam isn't always needed.

4. Standing desk.
   I'm terribly hyperactive. A standing desk helps me manage this. Additionally, the fact that I get up from time to time has a positive effect on my health, back, and overall physical condition. Sitting is moderately healthy. Contractures, spinal problems. You can really mess yourself up.

5. Proper chair
   Since we sit a lot, it's best to sit on something decent. Some like exercise balls, others ergonomic chairs, still others stools. There are many preferences. I personally recommend a proper chair like Ergohuman or something similar. A one-time expense, but it pays off.

The above things are, in my opinion, the basics of ergonomic remote work that are useful if we want to maintain health for years. Of course, you can work without them. You don't need to immediately equip yourself with a chair for a thousand dollars or a microphone for three hundred just for learning. No. However, if you're already a professional, don't be afraid to invest in your equipment. These are tools of your work just like any others. You'll make life easier for yourself and others.

I know this may seem funny, but subconsciously I take people who have a nice setup a bit more seriously. It's not a determinant of anything, but I just feel that way. It signals certain things to me subconsciously.

At the end of the day, of course, all that matters is whether you deliver and you're not a jerk, but still.

Here are some tips for people working remotely:

1. Create an appropriate workspace: Make sure your workspace is comfortable and ergonomic. Avoid working from bed or on the couch, as this can lead to spinal problems and other conditions.

2. Set time boundaries: It's important to set time boundaries for your work so that you can properly separate work and private life.

3. Take care of good communication: Remote work requires good communication with other team members and supervisors. Make sure you have access to appropriate communication tools, such as instant messengers or video conferences.

4. Take care of your health: Remote work can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which is not healthy. Make sure you maintain proper posture at your computer and get up every now and then to stretch and do some exercises.

5. Maintain discipline: Remote work can be difficult if you don't have proper discipline. Set your daily plan and stick to it as if you were working in an office.

6. Keep a routine: Remote work can be distracting, so it's important to keep a routine, such as setting fixed working hours and maintaining regular breaks.
