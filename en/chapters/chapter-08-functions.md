# Functions

Functions are a fundamental element of programming that allows grouping code for reusable purposes. They are also used to divide a program into smaller, more understandable fragments, which makes it easier to create and maintain, improving readability. And I've already mentioned that this is critically important, right? After all, you write code once, but read it dozens of times sometimes. You and other people.

What are functions and why are they important in programming? We'll talk about this more broadly in a moment. Let's start with regular functions.

## Regular Functions/Methods

First, let's discuss traditional functions, or when we're talking about functions defined in classes, methods.

#### Syntax for defining functions in Python.

In Python, a function definition starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses with arguments. The code inside the function is indented. Example of a function definition:

```python
def function_name(arg1, arg2):
    # function code
    return result
```
