# Python, What's It All About?

## Python - What's It All About?

Before we start learning Python, I'd like to tell you a bit about the history of the language itself, where it comes from, what its goals and assumptions are, how it has evolved and changed over the years, and how it looks now, where it's used and why.

## How to Use This Book

Wait, stop. I'd like to tell you a bit about how I think you should use this book. First of all, I tried to write it so that it naturally flows from one topic to the next - from simple topics to slightly more complicated ones. Thanks to its linear structure, it should be easy to understand.

However, if you're already a somewhat more experienced programmer, or you just want to refresh your memory about certain things, feel free to jump around - most chapters are relatively self-contained components.

Another thing I want to mention, or rather repeat, is the fact that in this book you won't find information only about Python. Besides information about the language itself, I'll try to introduce you to certain concepts from computer science in general, so that you know a bit more, so that you have an idea of how something works, why it works this way and not another.

I believe this is essential knowledge to become a good programmer who develops and goes far. Such chapters will be somewhat more theoretical in nature, but that doesn't mean they're boring - quite the opposite, in my opinion.

If you want to properly absorb the information contained here and really learn something new, then I strongly advise: first of all, take notes - short, concise, and simple.
