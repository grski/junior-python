# Databases

A bit about what's worth reading about and what databases are all about.

What are databases anyway? They're simply a place where we want to store some data in a relatively permanent way.

Databases are diverse and varied, divided into different categories. We'll talk about Relational ones and about the language that has been dominating database systems for decades - SQL. There are databases that don't use it, but that's not within the scope of this book.

I'll immediately point out that because there are different types of databases, sometimes there are flame wars. Which one is better, etc. Something like Linux vs Windows, which Linux distro is the best, Apples or Plums, etc.

The truth is that it's idiotic to praise only one solution in every situation. Each database has its own application and certain niches where it works best. Well, maybe except for OracleDB, which should have died long ago and stopped torturing people with its existence. Anyway.

## SQL

SQL is simply a database language that allows making queries on data. That's all you need to know. Plus, read about simple queries: SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, WHERE clause, and others.

Examples to analyze if you don't feel like googling on your own:
