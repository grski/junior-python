# Language Choice

In this book, we will primarily work with Python. Why? I've listed the reasons for choosing this language in another chapter, but I'd like to mention one other language that every programmer must know and should start with if they're 100% certain they want to pursue a career in IT. What language is that?

## The Essential Language

Interesting, what language could it be! C, Python? Maybe C++ or JavaScript? Not at all! I'm talking about... the English language.

We live in times of globalization. Everything is becoming somewhat standardized. The same TV shows, the same movies, the same clothes, brands, and... language. The English language has long been present in our native language - Polish. Anglicisms have existed for many, many years. However, in recent years, during the existence and development of global civilization, the number of anglicisms and borrowings appearing in our speech, especially among young people, is growing exponentially. And not without reason. And I say this as someone writing a book in Polish. You can manage without it if you insist, yes, but if you're serious about a career... No. Seriously.

English is the absolute hegemon when it comes to international communication or communication on the Internet. And we, as people closely related to this world, are somewhat forced to know it well. Practically in every company, English is the standard, and to be a good programmer, we need to know it well enough to communicate freely and read documentation. That's it on this topic. This implies that we need to know it well. Technical documentation is usually not that simple, contains specialized vocabulary, and has a difficult, formal style.

English is probably even more important at the beginning than the programming language we choose, which is why, before we start coding, it's worth improving in this area. What are the advantages of knowing this language?

### Materials

The matter is quite clear. The most high-quality materials are available in English. This book is an attempt to slightly change this fact and open the way for those who, despite everything, don't speak English, don't want to speak it, and maybe aren't thinking about a career in IT. Nevertheless, currently...

Want to learn more? Best from English materials. Moreover, sometimes English materials are the only ones available. Almost every framework or library I know has documentation. In English. In Polish, there's usually none, or if there is, the translation leaves much to be desired or is fragmentary.

That's right, translation. Certain terms in our world become quite strange and incomprehensible when translated. Can you imagine working daily with an "Integrated Programming Environment" (ZŚP) instead of an IDE? A "bug remover" instead of a debugger? A "kernel panic" instead of... well, kernel panic. For us, experienced programmers, this is unimaginable. No one outside your country would understand you. Instead of pulls and commits, we'd have "withdrawals" and "confirmations" (XD). Why have inits when we could have "starters"? Examples could be multiplied.

And documentation is fundamental, by the way. Whether when creating a serious project or when using one, you'll not only read it but also create it. How will you encourage other developers to work on your open-source project if they can't understand it because the source code and documentation are in Polish? In this way, you severely limit your horizons.

### Communication

Again, a key thing when creating projects. In most companies today, you collaborate with foreign clients or contractors from overseas. Many things can be streamlined and made easier when we can talk directly with someone and clarify certain things. Often, English is essential for this. Especially when someone who doesn't speak Polish joins your team.

This isn't as rare as it might seem, quite the opposite.

### Programming Itself

Learning programming itself is easier if we know English. Practically every programming language has keywords in English.

When we're just learning, this is quite helpful because even without seeing what a given keyword does or what a given function does, as long as they're properly named (and current good code standards generally require this), we can practically guess what the code does without any knowledge, without looking at the source, by inferring from the translation of the given fragment, the name of the function/class.

### Exceptions

I know, someone will immediately say, 'but how, I've been in the profession for five years and somehow manage without English!' Well, yes, but for how long and in what company? Want to work in Januszsoft? Be my guest, but I won't pay for the chemotherapy you'll need after experiencing the scale of stupidity and onion-like behavior that takes place while working for a typical Janusz. And believe me, that's how it will be because people who completely don't know English aren't really hired in other places.

What I wrote above is rather obvious to everyone somewhat familiar with the matter, but some people, at the beginning (including me), are quite stubborn about learning English.

Because I want to learn programming!!! Great, but to do it as efficiently as possible, English is useful, and then it's an unparalleled help in finding and doing the work itself.

That's about it on this issue. Although the question remains - how to learn?

## How to Get Started?

Let me explain.

### Well, How?

Let's start with how not to learn. A simple and perfect example of this is seen in our schools. How English is taught there is a joke. A sad one, but a joke.

The focus there is solely on the middle school exam, then on the high school graduation exam. Nothing else is thought about in 90% of cases. And what's on the exam and graduation? Not necessarily things used in everyday situations.

In high school, at least in my case, in the first year, a student has 5 hours of English, if they choose the advanced level in this language (rarely does someone not do this), then from the second year, they have 7 hours. Quite a lot, right? Yes, but how this time is used is a tragedy.

What does an average lesson look like?
You get a photocopy with grammatical structures that you fill in. Sometimes you write/say something. Thank you. Focus on grammar and... Nothing else. It can't be like this. I don't want to get into a discussion about how bad the current education system is, what needs to be changed in it, and so on. Of course, there are probably teachers who stand out from the norm and try, because they haven't been eaten by the concrete yet, but how many of them are there... Let's move on to the issue of...

### How Should It Look Then, Mr. Know-It-All?
I'll tell you. First of all, you can't focus all the time on something completely unnecessary for the most part - grammar.

Let's look at small children. Let's say from grades 1-2 of elementary school. Can they speak in their language? Yes, they can. Usually even relatively correctly. And let's ask this child what they know about parts of speech and sentences. We'll probably hear as much as a deaf person.

So the child doesn't really know grammar formally, but uses the language correctly. Interesting.

We should take an example from this and primarily remember not to focus on learning grammar during language learning. Of course, there are tiny exceptions to this rule, but they rather confirm the fact.

We should focus on using the language, not theorizing. Only this way will we learn it most effectively. Let me give an example. In English school, children usually start learning from kindergarten. It was no different with me - in so-called "zerówka" (pre-school), the first slow lessons began. In any case... 7 years later, my English still left much to be desired.

Fortunately, my approach to learning this language changed from forced to more practical. Textbooks faded into oblivion, writing and reading in this language came, communicating in it.

Suddenly, in two months, I made greater progress than in the previous 7 years, amazingly surprising myself. Grammar should result from practice. After some time, it comes naturally, and that we don't know the theory behind it...

Well. And do we know it in Polish? At least I don't. Only those complete basics that a child learns in elementary school. As for the rest... Hah. Maybe I'm a brainlet with 30 IQ, and everyone else knows, but I doubt it.

## Implementing This in Practice

In my opinion, several methods can be distinguished that should be applied.

### Translation

Let's start with the thing I like most and have the best opinion about. It's translation. What translation? Normal - you take a text in English and chop it into Polish.

Don't worry if you don't know the words. I didn't know them at all at the beginning. About 80% of words I had to check in a dictionary. But don't jump to it right away - try to infer something from the context first.

You can translate anything. I particularly recommend comics/manga/movie subtitles/some pictures. Why?

Because you see what's happening on the scene and can infer more things from the context. Thanks to this, you'll learn faster. Besides, you can also check your translation with translations by other people - for example, take some cartoon in English, translate a fragment and compare it with the Polish version, translated by a professional.

This way, you'll learn very quickly. Moreover - you'll start picking up certain phrases characteristic of this language and learn that we don't translate everything literally, that we speak somewhat differently in English because certain words have a different weight, structure, and meaning there than in our language, and literal translation is pointless. I recommend it. Additionally, you'll also learn to 'think' in English, which is essential at a certain, somewhat higher level.

I, for example, quite often have it that I want to express a certain thought, but I lack Polish equivalents for thoughts that I can express without problems in English because such a phrase exists there.

### Learning Words/Phrases

I'll write a bit about this too. It's nice to have a rich vocabulary in a given language, but we don't need too many words at the beginning. Do you know how many exactly are enough?

Just 25. Yes, 25 words. That's enough for the very beginning. Because according to research, these 25 words account for 33% of the content spoken by an average English speaker. So knowing 25 words, you can understand one-third of what a foreigner is saying to you.

Add to this understanding certain things from context or similarity in word sounds, and it turns out you can almost communicate. Your hands would probably hurt a bit from the conversation, but I think it would be possible. But 33% isn't such a satisfying result. Let's move on then - to understand 89%, 1000 words are enough. Significantly more, but still little.

Knowing 3000 words, we understand 95%. So basically, as if we understood in Polish. Because that 5% is, I suspect, made up of specialized words used in various strange professions. After all, it's the same in Polish - not everyone needs to know what a square, anchor, or trowel is. That is, most people who have worked on a construction site at some point, like this humble author of this book, will associate, but the rest? Not necessarily.

Similarly, in English, there are certain specialized words that are rarely useful and can be learned if needed.

So our goal here is to reach 1000 words. That's enough in my opinion for the beginning. We aim for at least 30 words a day. After a month, we're practically home. And how to learn them? Because just sitting and reading is pointless. I offer two great tools:

Memrise
Duolingo

Both these platforms are available for free, offering apps for Android or iOS.

I think there might even be a version for, horror of horrors, Windows Phone somewhere.

These two great platforms will help you learn English and other languages without any problems. Which one to choose, how do they differ?

Both help in learning, but Memrise is more diverse and dependent on content created by users. You can learn not only vocabulary there but also things like geography, history, literature, and many, many others. It works great for learning vocabulary.

What about Duolingo? Here we have a somewhat more systematic approach. Courses are prepared by a professional team (Memrise has these too, but not as many) and cover both vocabulary and grammar basics.

Nevertheless, both services are similar, teaching words, pronunciation, grammar. The choice is yours, although I admit that I use both.

Or rather used, because now I'm a lazy old man who doesn't want to learn new languages, arguing to myself that in a few years we'll have AI for translation.

### Listening

This probably goes without saying. I recommend movies and cartoons with subtitles, but English ones. Forget about Polish ones. If you don't understand something, pause, turn on subtitles and translate slowly. Definitely. Although actually, I don't know if I should recommend learning listening - once you start understanding a bit, it turns out that 90% of your favorite English-language songs lose their meaning. That sucks.

### Speaking

Talk to yourself, talk to family, friends, trees, dogs, microphones. There are special groups where you can arrange to talk with someone who's also learning or who will teach you in exchange for teaching Polish.

You can write to me and arrange a chat on Skype or TS, I'll be happy to help. You'll find contact on the blog - email, GitLab, GitHub, or on the 4programmers forum. Heck, we can even create a small group helping with language learning. I'm up for it, what do you say? And remember one thing - don't be afraid.

No one cares about your accent and pronunciation. Being in London or abroad in general, I've heard so many different versions of English that it's mind-boggling. Often even those for whom English is a national language can't understand each other due to accents and slang.

It's like talking with a Silesian. Only three times worse and besides the Silesian, you have 15 other groups. So relax. They'll understand you, no one will judge you, but rather encourage and appreciate the effort you put into trying to learn the language. Seriously.

### Reading

Consume content in English and that's it. Don't worry about the level of understanding at the beginning, relax. It will grow. You'll find a list of interesting blogs on programming topics at the end of this book, check the table of contents.

### DeepL

A good exercise is writing sentences in Polish, let's say 10, then translating these entire sentences using DeepL. Simple sentences are enough. DeepL is something like Google Translate. Then we reverse the process. We write 10 other sentences ourselves and check correctness in DeepL.

## To Sum Up

Following these tips and dedicating about 2 hours a day, after a month you'll understand about 70-80% of everyday conversations in a foreign language quite fluently!

Of course, we're talking about simple conversations conducted with a normal accent, but still. The specialized vocabulary you'll need while learning programming, you'll pick up along the way.

Remember especially these two links to Memrise and Duolingo and that you should translate, read, listen, and speak as much as possible.

Besides, I strongly encourage you to check out Radek Kotarski's book "Hack Your Brain" - it's a collection of interesting techniques and tips on how to learn to really learn, to remember quickly and effectively.

No, Kotarski didn't slip me any cash for advertising. A shame, I'm always happy to hug some shekels.

In any case. Let's finally move on to describing the language we'll mainly deal with here.
