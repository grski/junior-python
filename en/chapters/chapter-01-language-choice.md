# Choosing a Language

In this book, we'll be working almost exclusively with Python. Why? The reasons I chose this particular language are outlined in another chapter, but I'd like to mention one other language that every programmer must know and should start with if they're 100% certain they want to pursue a career in IT. What language is that?

## The Essential Language

Curious what language it might be! C, Python? Maybe C++ or JavaScript? Not at all! I'm talking about... the English language.

We live in an era of globalization. Everything is becoming somewhat uniform. The same TV shows, the same movies, the same clothes, brands, and... language. English has been present in many languages for a long time, but in recent years, especially during the development of our global civilization, the amount of English influence appearing in everyday speech, especially among young people, has been growing exponentially. There's a good reason for that. You might manage without it if you're stubborn, sure, but if you're serious about a career... No. Really.

English is the absolute hegemon when it comes to international communication or communication on the Internet. As people closely connected to this world, we're somewhat forced to know it well. In practically every company, English is the standard, and to be a good programmer, we need to know it well enough to communicate freely and read documentation. That implies we need to know it well. Technical documentation is usually not that simple; it contains specialized vocabulary and has a difficult, formal style.

English is actually even more important at the beginning than the programming language you choose, so before we start coding, it's worth improving in this area. What are the benefits of knowing this language?

### Materials

The matter is quite clear. The most and best quality materials are available in English. This book is an attempt to slightly change that fact and open the door for those who still don't speak English, don't want to learn it, or perhaps aren't thinking about an IT career. Nevertheless, currently...

Want to learn more? Best from English materials. Moreover, sometimes English materials are the only ones available. Almost every framework or library I know has documentation. In English. In other languages, there's usually nothing, poor translations, or only partial coverage.

Speaking of translation, certain terms in our world become quite strange and incomprehensible when translated. Can you imagine working daily with translated technical terms instead of using the original English ones? Who would understand you outside your own country? Examples could be multiplied.

And documentation is fundamental, by the way. Whether creating a serious project or using one, you'll not only read it but also create it. How will you encourage other developers to work on your open-source project if they can't understand it because the source code and documentation are in a language they don't speak? This way you severely limit your horizons.

### Communication

Again, a crucial thing when creating projects. In most companies today, you work with foreign clients or contractors from overseas. Many things can be streamlined and made easier when you can directly talk to someone and explain certain things. English is often essential for this. Especially when someone who doesn't speak your native language joins your team.

This is not as rare as it might seem, quite the opposite.

### Programming Itself

Learning programming itself is easier if we know English. Practically every programming language has keywords in English.

When we're just learning, this is quite helpful because even without seeing what a given keyword does, or what a given function does, as long as they're correctly named (and current good code standards require this), we can practically guess what the code does without any prior knowledge, without looking at the source, just by translating the fragment or function/class name.

### Exceptions

Sure, someone will immediately say 'but hey, I've been working in the field for five years and I'm doing fine without English!' Sort of, but for how long and at what kind of company? Want to work at a low-quality shop? Go ahead, but trust me, that's probably how it'll go, because people who don't know English at all aren't usually hired elsewhere.

What I wrote above is rather obvious to anyone familiar with the matter, but some people, at the beginning (including myself), are quite stubborn about learning English.

Because I want to learn programming!!! Cool, but to do it as efficiently as possible, English is helpful, and later it's invaluable help when looking for and doing the job itself.

That's about it on this matter. Although one question remains - how do you learn?

## How to Get Started?

Let me explain.

### So, How?

Let's start with how not to learn. A simple and excellent example of this is the traditional school system. The way English is taught in many schools is a joke. A sad one, but still a joke.

The focus is typically on exams - first high school exams, then standardized tests. Nothing else matters 90% of the time. And what's on the exam? Not necessarily things you use in everyday situations.

Being in high school, at least in my case, in the first year a student has 5 hours of English, and if they choose to focus on this language (few don't), from the second year they have 7 hours. Quite a lot, right? Yes, but how this time is used is tragic.

What does the average lesson look like? You get a worksheet with grammatical structures to fill in. Sometimes you write/say something. Thank you. Focus on grammar and... Nothing more. That can't be right. I don't want to get into discussions about how bad the current education system is, what should be changed in it, and so on. Of course, there are probably teachers who deviate from the norm and try, because they haven't been crushed by the system yet, but how many are there... Let's move on to the question of...

### So How Should It Look, Smarty-Pants?

Let me tell you. First of all, you can't focus all the time on something largely unnecessary - grammar.

Let's look at small children. Say, 1st-2nd grade elementary school. Can they speak in their language? Sure they can. Usually quite correctly too. But ask that child what they know about parts of speech and sentences. You'll hear about as much as you would from a deaf person.

So the child doesn't formally know grammar, but uses the language correctly. Interesting.

We should take an example from this and above all remember not to focus on learning grammar when learning a language. Of course, there are small exceptions to this rule, but they rather confirm the fact.

You should focus on using the language, not theorizing. That's the only way to learn it most effectively. I'll give an example. Children usually start learning English from kindergarten in school. It was no different for me - in the so-called prep year, the first slow lessons began. Anyway... 7 years later, my English still left a lot to be desired.

Fortunately, my approach to learning this language changed from obligation to more practical. Textbooks were forgotten, writing and reading in the language came along, communicating in it.

Suddenly in two months I made more progress than in the previous 7 years, surprising myself immensely. Grammar should come from practice. After some time it comes naturally, and that we don't know the theory behind it...

Well. Do we know it in our native language? At least I don't. Only the absolute basics that are taught to children in elementary school. As for the rest... Hah. Maybe I'm just dense, but I doubt everyone else knows it either.

## Implementing This in Practice

In my opinion, several methods should be used.

### Translation

Let's start with something I like the most and have the best opinion of. It's translation. What kind of translation? Normal - you take a text in English and translate it to your native language.

Don't worry if you don't know the words. I didn't know any at the beginning. I had to check about 80% of the words in a dictionary. But don't jump to it right away - try to infer something from context first.

You can translate anything. I personally recommend especially comics/manga/movie subtitles/images. Why?

Because you see what's happening in the scene and can infer more things from context. This way you'll learn faster. Besides, you can also check your translation against translations by other people - for example, take a cartoon in English, translate a fragment and compare it with the version translated by a professional.

This way you'll learn very quickly. Moreover, you'll start picking up certain phrases characteristic of the language and learn that we don't translate everything literally, that things are said a bit differently in English, because certain words have different weight, structure, and meaning there, and literal translation makes no sense. I recommend it. Additionally, you'll also learn to 'think' in English, which is essential at a certain, somewhat higher level.

For example, I quite often have a thought I want to express, but I lack equivalents in my native language for a thought I can easily express in English, because there's just such an expression there.

### Learning Words/Phrases

I'll write a bit here too. It's nice to have a rich vocabulary in a given language, but we don't need too many words at the beginning. Do you know how many exactly is enough?

Just 25. Yes, 25 words. That's enough for the very beginning. Because according to research, these 25 words account for 33% of the content spoken by the average English speaker. So knowing 25 words, you can understand one-third of what a foreigner says to you.

Add to that understanding certain things from context or the similarity of word sounds, and it turns out you almost understand each other. Your hands would probably hurt a bit from gesturing, but I think you could manage. But 33% is not a satisfying result. Let's move on then - to understand 89%, you need 1000 words. Much more, but still little.

Knowing 3 thousand words, we'll understand 95%. Basically the same as understanding our native language. Because those 5% are probably specialized words used in various strange professions. Just like you don't need to know all the jargon in your native language either.

Similarly in English, there are certain specialized words that are rarely needed and can be learned when necessary.

So our goal here is to reach 1000 words. That's enough to start with in my opinion. We aim for at least 30 words a day. After a month, we're practically home. And how to learn them? Because just sitting and reading makes no sense. I offer two great tools:

Memrise
Duolingo

Both platforms are available for free, offering Android and iOS apps.

These two great platforms will easily help you learn English and other languages. Which one to choose, how do they differ?

Both help with learning, but Memrise is more varied and dependent on content created by users. You can learn not only vocabulary but also things like geography, history, literature, and many, many others. It works great for learning vocabulary.

What about Duolingo? Here we have a slightly more systematic approach. Courses are prepared by a professional team (Memrise has those too, but not as many) and they cover both vocabulary and grammar basics.

Nevertheless, both services are similar, teaching words, pronunciation, grammar. I leave the choice to you, although I admit I use both.

Or rather, I used to, because now I'm a lazy person who doesn't feel like learning new languages, arguing that in a few years we'll have AI for translation.

### Listening

This is probably self-explanatory. I recommend movies and cartoons with subtitles, but English ones. Forget about subtitles in your native language. If you don't understand something, pause, turn on subtitles and translate slowly. A must. Although I don't know if I should recommend learning listening - once you start understanding a bit, you'll find that 90% of your favorite English songs lose their sense. That sucks.

### Speaking

Talk to yourself, talk to family, friends, trees, dogs, microphones. There are special groups where you can arrange to talk with someone who's also learning, or who will teach you in exchange for teaching your language.

You can write to me and arrange a Skype or voice chat, I'll be happy to help. You can find contact on my blog - email, GitLab, GitHub, or on programming forums. We can even create a small group to help with learning languages. I'm in, what about you? And remember one thing - don't be afraid.

No one cares about your accent and pronunciation. Being in London or abroad in general, I've heard so many different versions of the English language that it's mind-boggling. Often even those for whom English is their native language can't understand each other due to accents and slang.

So relax. They'll understand you, no one will judge you, but rather encourage and appreciate the effort you put into trying to learn the language. Seriously.

### Reading

Consume content in English and that's it. Don't worry about the degree of understanding at the beginning, relax. It will grow. You can find a list of interesting programming blogs at the end of this book, check the table of contents.

### DeepL

A nice exercise is writing sentences in your native language, let's say 10, then translating all those sentences using DeepL. Simple sentences are enough. DeepL is something like Google Translate. Then we reverse the process. We write 10 other sentences ourselves and check correctness in DeepL.

## Summing Up

By following this advice and spending about 2 hours a day, after a month you'll quite fluently understand about 70-80% of everyday conversations in a foreign language!

Of course, this is about simple conversations, conducted with a normal accent, but still. Specialized vocabulary that you'll need when learning programming, you'll pick up along the way.

So remember especially these two links to Memrise and Duolingo, and that you should translate, read, listen, and speak as much as possible.

Additionally, I warmly encourage you to check out books on learning techniques - there are great resources on how to learn effectively, how to memorize quickly and efficiently.

In any case. Let's finally move on to describing the language we'll mainly be dealing with here.
