# Language Choice

In this book, we will primarily work with Python. Why? I've listed the reasons for choosing this language in another chapter, but I'd like to mention one other language that every programmer must know and should start with if they're 100% certain they want to pursue a career in IT. What language is that?

## The Essential Language

Interesting, what language could it be! C, Python? Maybe C++ or JavaScript? Not at all! I'm talking about... the English language.

We live in times of globalization. Everything is becoming somewhat standardized. The same TV shows, the same movies, the same clothes, brands, and... language. The English language has long been present in our native language - Polish. Anglicisms have existed for many, many years, but in recent years, during the existence and development of global civilization, the number of anglicisms and loanwords appearing in our speech, especially among young people, is growing exponentially. And not without reason. And I'm saying this as someone writing a book in Polish. If you're stubborn, you can manage without it, sure, but if you're serious about your career... No. Seriously.

The English language is an absolute hegemon when it comes to international communication or communication on the Internet. And we, as people closely connected to this world, are somewhat forced to know it well. Practically in every company, English is the standard, and to be a good programmer, we need to know it well enough to communicate freely and read documentation - that's the bottom line. This implies that we need to know it well. Technical documentation is usually not that simple, it contains specialized vocabulary and has a difficult, formal style.

The English language is probably even more important at the beginning than the programming language we choose, which is why, before we start coding, it's worth improving our skills in this area. What are the advantages of knowing this language?

### Materials

The situation is quite clear. The most high-quality materials are available in English. This book is an attempt to slightly change this fact and open the door for those who, despite everything, don't speak English, don't want to speak it, and maybe aren't thinking about a career in IT. Nevertheless, currently, it's the case that...
