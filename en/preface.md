# Preface

Pompously and with a bang. Also, a note: if you don't want to get into the details of Python's history, you're not interested in who the author is or why this book exists, and you just want to jump straight into the action, I'll summarize the next ~50 pages for you: Python is cool, install SublimeText/Vim/PyCharm/Visual Studio Code (anything at the beginning, seriously) and skip to chapter 4.

## What's This All About?

This book is essentially nothing more than another work about Python, but not only that. It's a consolidation of all my technical knowledge as well as soft skills that I possessed when starting out as a Junior Developer, or even now, a bit further along, when I don't necessarily see myself as a fledgling junior anymore. I'll cover various topics here, from the recruitment process itself, through contracts, soft skills, description of my development, useful things, as well as the programming meat itself - the proportion will be roughly fifty-fifty. In addition to the text itself, I'll also provide references and materials for independent study here.

I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking or innovative, but on the other hand, it kind of is. Why? What makes this book stand out? The fact that while writing it, I had one goal in mind - for it to be as simple as possible to understand, while thoroughly analyzing the topics in an interesting way, and the fact that this won't be a book only about Python, no.

This is meant to be a complete introduction to a wide range of topics related to programming and working as a programmer, getting a job, tools used in the field, but also teaching you the most important skill for a programmer - the ability to search for and process information, because that's what computer science is all about.

In short, it's an introduction to a complete set of skills, traits, and tools, mastering which will make you somewhat ready to start your adventure as a programmer. However, don't think you'll read one book and boom, off to work. Oh no. This is the first step on a very long road.

I don't want this to be just another ordinary Python textbook dealing only with it - there are already many of those. I want you, my reader, after getting through this book, to know a bit more than before, to have outlined at least a general picture of what a programmer's job looks like, what this world looks like, whether it's worth entering, what the pros and cons of this work are, what exactly you need to know, where to learn it, and so on.

My dream is that after reading this book, you'll be like a curious child who has been shown a new toy - full of interest and determination to play with it. Whether for a moment or maybe longer, doesn't matter.

I simply hope that this book will somehow positively influence your knowledge, or perhaps your life, allowing you to take, for example, the first step in changing your career or starting one. Simply that I'll help you somehow. That's its purpose. It stems from the fact that my biggest dream, my personal meaning of life, is to influence as many people as possible, to bring something positive into their lives.

Many people helped me too, so I want to pass the baton forward - that's my intention.

I hope I'll somehow manage to accomplish it. If so, remember, I'd love to hear your story, or even publish it on my blog - grski.pl - maybe then it will be you helping others? So if this book somehow expands your knowledge or gives you something useful, write to me!

When I was giving private lessons, long before I became a programmer, I learned that first, by teaching others, you teach yourself too, and second, dry facts aren't always enough for someone to understand a given topic. You need interesting examples, unusual analogies, and exercises. That's how I'll try to convey knowledge in this book - simply, but also interestingly.

I'm directing it therefore to rather beginner people who want to slowly and thoroughly understand certain concepts related to Python itself, as well as computer science in general, to gain some IT savvy, but I believe someone experienced will also find some tidbits here that might be interesting. The book will be rather full of simplifications that I'll make for easier understanding, so I apologize in advance for all inaccuracies, but that's necessary. Sometimes reading technical books, it seems to me that their authors are afraid that if they write something simply, understandably, people will consider them fools or something. As a result, we get texts that make you wonder how deeply the author of such a work impaled themselves on a stick while sitting down.

This book is also a kind of summary, or perhaps a small digest of what's worth knowing when starting, for example, your first job. So if you're looking for a quick guide to Python's key functions, well, it's probably not for you. If you're a beginning programmer and want to expand your horizons or get to know the basics of Python more broadly, then please continue. I'll try to include answers to all the questions I had at the beginning of my journey.

This text is also the result of asking myself one question. What? You know what I mean? It came up precisely in the context of my knowledge of Python and programming in general, and despite the fact that I was already working as a programmer in that language - I was supposedly a full-fledged junior, unfortunately, I had to answer... No.

I suspect that fundamentally there are quite a few such people, after all. Often we ourselves don't realize how shallow our knowledge is, even though we somehow manage at work.

Especially if we consider old, mature, and developed languages like Python, Java, or C++. About the latter, even its creator is afraid to say that he knows it better than at an 8/10 level. That says something. Anyway. After I answered this question and realized that my understanding of Python was shallow, I decided to change that, to get to the next level.

There is and always has been in me a desire for development, which I neglected for some time, which ended in stagnation and even regression. It couldn't continue like that, so I fixed it.

And once I did, I decided to write down my thoughts, knowledge, and experiences right here, but that's not the only reason. To write this book, I'll have to educate myself on a considerable number of topics to present everything reliably and sensibly, because it would be shameful to give you, dear reader, a half-baked product just to publish something.

At this point, I don't know how many pages this book will ultimately have, but I'm sure of one thing - it won't be short. Mentally I have a preliminary picture telling me that I won't go below 250 pages. Especially considering the fact that once I start talking, it's sometimes hard to stop, because one topic leads to the next and so on in circles.

One last kind of note - my writing style is specific. As you can see. Just like that. I have my mannerisms, it's been pointed out to me many times by various people and I'm aware of it, nevertheless I consider it part of the specifics of my works.

I don't intend to change that. Similarly, the fact that in this book there may appear both strange and lofty words, as well as simple, colloquial ones. That's just who I am. If colloquial vocabulary and infantile style scares you, I advise you to quickly put this book down. I'm not saying this from an arrogant position but simply giving good advice.

Sometimes there will be some unfunny jokes, dark humor, and personal remarks, descriptions of my experiences, not necessarily politically correct.

I think that's it for my short foreword or something like that. Actually, I don't really know how all this should look - I'm a simple person who simply wants to share with you some piece of, perhaps, useful knowledge. Only that and yet so much.

## In Short

...speaking, this book will also be somewhat of a guide and reference to other materials that you need to work through independently. I only discussed more deeply and thoroughly, in my opinion, those topics that are often neglected.

## Acknowledgments

At the very beginning of my book, I'll serve myself, and incidentally you too, a bit of humility - it might seem that these words, because this is a book after all, and books are often created by serious people, are written by some successful person, a great programmer, a know-it-all.

Nothing could be further from the truth - in myself I'm a slight and simple little person who got to where he is largely thanks to the help of many people, some of whom will be listed below, and I would like to thank all of them.

If this doesn't interest you, just like the peculiar dedication that found its way here, skip a few pages.

To some I address directly, to others in the third person, variously. For no particular reason. So I thank...

...my most beloved and only Grandmother. For everything, for the person I am. For love. For sacrifices.

...you, **Wiktoria Chmielewska**, for the two happiest trips of my life, for dedication, for care and friendship, for saving my skin and not giving up when others had long done so.

...you, **Lukasz and Batu**. Nice that you're here. What more can I write, God is love and high five boss.

...you, **Rafal**, along with your family, which I won't list here for your privacy - your family, of which I feel I've somewhat become a part, for surrounding me with care, teaching me many things, and having a real, great impact on me and my life. I don't have a father, but if someone asked me who is the closest image of one to me, I probably wouldn't think for long.

...you, **Dearest**. C R A B B I N G.

...**Jakub Gasiorski**, the person who conducted my interview for my first job. I believe it's to him I owe the fact that ultimately the decision was made to hire me, because he decided to give me a chance then and later, many times. Thanks are also due here to **Maciej Mondrzycki**, CEO of YumaSoft, because the final decision whether to invest in me was his.

...**Sebastian Opalczynski**, as he's the person I consider my first mentor, some kind of role model for how to develop as a programmer, and a person who contributed greatly to the creation of this book. He lifted me above what I could achieve alone and I owe him a lot, really. Thanks baldy. Sometimes he pointed me in the right direction on a few things, patiently answered various questions, I also fondly remember various conversations we had. You're a very good teacher and person. Have you ever wondered what an alpha male is?

...**Piotrek Nietrzebka** for being a human when needed, a cunning old fox on other occasions, for showing certain flaws and that they can be overcome, or at least you can try, for keeping a promise.

...my various friends, inspirations, good people, **Tomasz, Andrzej**, (not the big guy, because he raises my blood pressure and needs to see a psychiatrist), **Adam, Takura, Amelia, Dima**. Okay, the big guy too.

...do not think that I've forgotten about you, my dear brother, **Kunaal**. I thank you and I'm grateful that you've been there for me. Always.

...all those who taught me something or helped me on my path, whom I haven't mentioned here, because honestly, this text would be too long, just like that.

As you can see for yourselves, Readers, I was lucky, and actually probably more lucky than sensible overall, to meet on my path a really large number of people who helped me.

Of course, nothing happened by itself and fulfilling my dream - getting a job as a programmer and fulfilling myself in the profession - required a lot of work and perseverance from me, but I don't owe my success only to myself, by no means.

What's my point with this? To remind you, as well as myself, that it's worth taking care of the people we have around us and who help us, who are important and helpful to us. I didn't know this for a long time myself, doing various, not necessarily good, things.

That's why I'm including these pages here, to forever have something that will remind me of this.

Once again. Thank you, I, Olaf.

## Dedication

I dedicate this book to true happiness, which I found in life only for a few moments, in a thumb, in an elevator with limes, on the slope of a former orchard, by a pole near the central station where Little Zakopane was born, by the 3E principle. May I experience more such moments.

**Above all, however, I also dedicate it to all those who, in my darkest and worst moments in personal life, helped me. Often multiple times and with great effort. Thank you, I will never forget**. You know who you are. I wonder what I did in life to come across you.
