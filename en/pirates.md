# A Few Words to Pirates and About Copyright

Arrr! I reserve all rights to this book and the content I've created within it, but I know life can be tough sometimes. If you're in a difficult situation, you simply don't have the money, or your parents won't give it to you because you're dependent on them, you don't need to pirate this book.

Just reach out to me. I'll send you a nice PDF for free. I've been in that place too, I know how it goes. You don't need to search around on sketchy websites. Hit me up via email and we'll figure something out without any problem. `olafgorski@pm.me` / `grski.pl`

And even if you did download this book illegally, I still thank you for taking the time to read it.
